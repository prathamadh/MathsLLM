$\textbf{(A) } 10\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 13 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 12 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 16$","Solve the following mathematical problem: What is the perimeter of the boundary of the region consisting of all points which can be expressed as $(2u-3w, v+4w)$ with $0\le u\le1$ $0\le v\le1,$ and $0\le w\le1$
$\textbf{(A) } 10\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 13 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 12 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 18 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 16$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand the parametric equations that describe the region defined by the points \((2u-3w, v+4w)\) with the constraints \(0 \le u \le 1\), \(0 \le v \le 1\), and \(0 \le w \le 1\).

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Parametric Equations:**
   \[
   x = 2u - 3w
   \]
   \[
   y = v + 4w
   \]

2. **Constraints:**
   \[
   0 \le u \le 1, \quad 0 \le v \le 1, \quad 0 \le w \le 1
   \]

3. **Determine the Boundary:**
   We need to find the perimeter of the boundary formed by these points. This involves finding the extreme points for \(x\) and \(y\) as \(u\), \(v\), and \(w\) vary within their given ranges.

4. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   We can calculate the perimeter by finding the distance between key points and summing them up.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the perimeter.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
u, v, w = sp.symbols('u v w')

# Define the parametric equations
x = 2*u - 3*w
y = v + 4*w

# Define the constraints
constraints = [(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 1)]

# Calculate the boundary points for x and y

We first fix $u$ and $v$ to $0$ , and graph $(-3w,4w)$ from $0\le w\le1$ . When $w$ is $0$ , we have the point $(0,0)$ , and when $w$ is $1$ , we have the point $(-3,4)$ . We see that since this is a directly proportional function, we can just connect the dots like this:
[asy] 	import graph; 	Label f; size(5cm); 	unitsize(0.7cm);  	xaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0)); 	yaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0));  	draw((0,0)--(-3,4)); 	[/asy]
Now, when we vary $u$ from $0$ to $2$ , this line is translated to the right $2$ units:
[asy] 	import graph; 	Label f;  	unitsize(0.7cm); size(5cm); 	xaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0)); 	yaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0));  	draw((0,0)--(-3,4)); 	draw((2,0)--(-1,4)); 	[/asy]
We know that any points in the region between the line (or rather segment) and its translation satisfy $w$ and $u$ , so we shade in the region:
[asy] 	import graph; 	Label f;  	unitsize(0.7cm); size(5cm); 	xaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0)); 	yaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0));  	draw((0,0)--(-3,4)); 	draw((2,0)--(-1,4));  	filldraw((0,0)--(-3,4)--(-1,4)--(2,0)--cycle, gray); 	[/asy]
We can also shift this quadrilateral one unit up, because of $v$ . Thus, this is our figure:
[asy] 	import graph; 	Label f;  	unitsize(0.7cm); size(5cm); 	xaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0)); 	yaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 5.0, 1.0));  	draw((0,0)--(-3,4)); 	draw((2,0)--(-1,4));  	filldraw((0,0)--(-3,4)--(-1,4)--(2,0)--cycle, gray); 	filldraw((0,1)--(-3,5)--(-1,5)--(2,1)--cycle, gray);  draw((0,0)--(0,1),black+dashed); draw((2,0)--(2,1),black+dashed); draw((-3,4)--(-3,5),black+dashed); 	[/asy]

The length of the boundary is simply $1+2+5+1+2+5$ $5$ can be obtained by Pythagorean theorem since we have side lengths $3$ and $4$ .). This equals $\boxed{16.}$"

Case 1: $u = 0, v = 0, w = 0 \implies (0, 0)$
Case 2: $u = 0, v = 0, w = 1 \implies (-3, 4)$
Case 3: $u = 0, v = 1, w = 0 \implies (0, 1)$

Notice how there are two distinct rectangles visible in the figure. This leads us to believe that the region tracks the motion of this region as it travels in space. To understand why this is true, we can imagine a fixed $w$ (as it is present in both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates). Then if we hold one of $u$ or $v$ fixed and let the other vary, we get a straight line parallel to the $x$ or $y$ axis respectively. If we let the other vary, we get the other type of straight line. Together, they form a rectangular region. In addition, $w$ serves as a diagonal translation, so if we now let $w$ vary, it traces out the motion of the rectangle. Keeping this in mind, we connect the dots.

### Solution: To determine how many laps Mike completed in the first 27 minutes, we need to calculate his lap completion rate and then use that rate to find the number of laps in the given time.

First, we calculate Mike's lap completion rate per minute:
\[
\text{Lap completion rate} = \frac{15 \text{ laps}}{57 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Next, we use this rate to find the number of laps completed in 27 minutes:
\[
\text{Laps in 27 minutes} = \text{Lap completion rate} \times 27 \text{ minutes}
\]

Let's compute this using Python.
```python
# Given values
total_laps = 15
total_minutes = 57
target_minutes = 27

# Calculate lap completion rate
lap_completion_rate = total_laps / total_minutes

# Calculate laps completed in target minutes
laps_in_target_minutes = lap_completion_rate * target_minutes
print(laps_in_target_minutes)
```
```output
5.0
```
Based on the calculations, Mike completed approximately 5 laps in the first 27 minutes.

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{5}\).
","Mike's speed is $\frac{15}{57}=\frac{5}{19}$ laps per minute.

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the three numbers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers.

Let's denote the three numbers as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

The given conditions are:
1. \(a + b + c = 96\)
2. \(a = 6c\)
3. \(c = b - 40\)

We can use these equations to solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, substitute \(a = 6c\) into the first equation:
\[6c + b + c = 96\]
\[7c + b = 96\]

Next, substitute \(c = b - 40\) into the modified first equation:
\[7(b - 40) + b = 96\]
\[7b - 280 + b = 96\]
\[8b - 280 = 96\]
\[8b = 376\]
\[b = 47\]

Now, substitute \(b = 47\) back into \(c = b - 40\):
\[c = 47 - 40\]
\[c = 7\]

Finally, substitute \(c = 7\) back into \(a = 6c\):
\[a = 6 \times 7\]
\[a = 42\]

Now we have \(a = 42\), \(b = 47\), and \(c = 7\).

The absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is:
\[|a - b| = |42 - 47| = | -5 | = 5\]

Let's confirm this with","Let $x$ be the third number. It follows that the first number is $6x,$ and the second number is $x+40.$

\[6c + b + c = 96\]
\[7c + b = 96\]

Next, substitute \(c = b - 40\) into the modified first equation:
\[7(b - 40) + b = 96\]
\[7b - 280 + b = 96\]
\[8b - 280 = 96\]
\[8b = 376\]
\[b = 47\]

Now, substitute \(b = 47\) back into \(c = b - 40\):
\[c = 47 - 40\]
\[c = 7\]

Finally, substitute \(c = 7\) back into \(a = 6c\):
\[a = 6 \times 7\]
\[a = 42\]

Now we have \(a = 42\), \(b = 47\), and \(c = 7\).

The absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is:
\[|a - b| = |42 - 47| = | -5 | = 5\]

Let's confirm this with","Solve this using a system of equations. Let $x,y,$ and $z$ be the three numbers, respectively. We get three equations: \begin{align*} x+y+z&=96, \\ x&=6z, \\ z&=y-40. \end{align*} Rewriting the third equation gives us $y=z+40,$ so we can substitute $x$ as $6z$ and $y$ as $z+40.$
Therefore, we get \begin{align*} 6z+(z+40)+z&=96 \\ 8z+40&=96 \\ 8z&=56 \\ z&=7. \end{align*} Substituting 7 in for $z$ gives us $x=6z=6(7)=42$ and $y=z+40=7+40=47.$

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the three numbers that satisfy the given conditions and then calculate the absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers.

Let's denote the three numbers as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

The given conditions are:
1. \(a + b + c = 96\)
2. \(a = 6c\)
3. \(c = b - 40\)

We can use these equations to solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, substitute \(a = 6c\) into the first equation:
\[6c + b + c = 96\]
\[7c + b = 96\]

Next, substitute \(c = b - 40\) into the modified first equation:
\[7(b - 40) + b = 96\]
\[7b - 280 + b = 96\]
\[8b - 280 = 96\]
\[8b = 376\]
\[b = 47\]

Now, substitute \(b = 47\) back into \(c = b - 40\):
\[c = 47 - 40\]
\[c = 7\]

Finally, substitute \(c = 7\) back into \(a = 6c\):
\[a = 6 \times 7\]
\[a = 42\]

Now we have \(a = 42\), \(b = 47\), and \(c = 7\).

The absolute value of the difference between the first and second numbers is:
\[|a - b| = |42 - 47| = | -5 | = 5\]

Let's confirm this with","In accordance with Solution 2, \[y = z+40, x = 6z \implies |x-y| = |6z - z - 40| = 5|z - 8| \implies \boxed{5}.\] vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to convert the fuel efficiency from miles per gallon (mpg) to liters per 100 kilometers (l/100km). Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - 1 kilometer equals \( m \) miles.
   - 1 gallon equals \( l \) liters.
   - The car gets \( x \) miles per gallon (mpg).

2. **Convert miles per gallon to kilometers per gallon:**

   \[
   \text{Liters per kilometer} = \frac{1 \text{ gallon}}{xm \text{ km}} \times l \text{ liters} = \frac{l}{xm} \text{ liters/km}
   \]
   Then, convert this to liters per 100 kilometers:","The formula for fuel efficiency is \[\frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Gas Consumption}}.\] Note that $1$ mile equals $\frac 1m$ kilometers.

The distance between the two closest vertices of the squares is thus $IJ=\left(4\sqrt{2}\right).$ Substituting, we get
\[(IJ)^2 = (w-2)^2 + (\ell-2)^2 = \left(4\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 32 \implies w^2+\ell^2-4w-4\ell = 24.\] Using the fact that the diagonal of the rectangle is $8,$ we get \[w^2+\ell^2 = 64.\] Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get \[4w+4\ell=40 \implies w+\ell = 10.\] Squaring yields \[w^2 + 2w\ell + \ell^2 = 100.\] Subtracting the second equation from this, we get $2w\ell = 36,$ and thus area of the original rectangle is $w\ell = \boxed{18}.$"

$\textbf{(A) } 5 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 7 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 8 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9$
### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \( m \) for which the two expressions \( 2^m \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4096}} \) and \( 2 \cdot \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}} \) are equal.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Simplify the first expression:**
   \[
   2^m \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4096}}
   \]
   Note that \( 4096 = 2^{12} \), so:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1}{4096}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^{12}}} = \frac{1}{2^6} = 2^{-6}
   \]
   Therefore, the first expression simplifies to:
   \[
   2^m \cdot 2^{-6} = 2^{m - 6}
   \]

2. **Simplify the second expression:**
   \[
   2 \cdot \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}}
   \]
   Again, \( 4096 = 2^{12} \), so:
   \[
   \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}} = \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{2^{12}}} = \left(\frac{1}{2^{12}}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}} = 2^{-\frac{12}{m}}
   \]
   Therefore, the second expression simplifies to:
   \[
   2 \cdot 2^{-\frac{12}{m}} = 2^{1 - \frac{12}{m}}
","We are given that \[2^m\cdot\sqrt{\frac{1}{4096}} = 2\cdot\sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}}.\] Converting everything into powers of $2,$ we have \begin{align*} 2^m\cdot(2^{-12})^{\frac12} &= 2\cdot (2^{-12})^{\frac1m} \\ 2^{m-6} &= 2^{1-\frac{12}{m}} \\ m-6 &= 1-\frac{12}{m}. \end{align*} We multiply both sides by $m$ , then rearrange as \[m^2-7m+12=0.\] By Vieta's Formulas, the sum of such values of $m$ is $\boxed{7}.$"

   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1}{4096}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2^{12}}} = \frac{1}{2^6} = 2^{-6}
   \]
   Therefore, the first expression simplifies to:
   \[
   2^m \cdot 2^{-6} = 2^{m - 6}
   \]

2. **Simplify the second expression:**
   \[
   2 \cdot \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}}
   \]
   Again, \( 4096 = 2^{12} \), so:
   \[
   \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{4096}} = \sqrt[m]{\frac{1}{2^{12}}} = \left(\frac{1}{2^{12}}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}} = 2^{-\frac{12}{m}}
   \]
   Therefore, the second expression simplifies to:
   \[
   2 \cdot 2^{-\frac{12}{m}} = 2^{1 - \frac{12}{m}}
","We can rewrite the equation using fractional exponents and take logarithms of both sides: \[\log_2{(2^{m}\cdot4096^{-1/2}}) = \log_2{(2\cdot4096^{-1/m})}.\] We can then use the additive properties of logarithms to split them up: \[\log_2{(2^{m})} + \log_2{(4096^{-1/2})} = \log_2{2} + \log_2{(4096^{-1/m})}.\] Using the power rule, the fact that $4096 = 2^{12},$ and bringing the exponents down, we get \begin{align*} m - 6 &= 1 - \frac{12}{m} \\ m + \frac{12}{m} &= 7 \\ m^{2} + 12 &= 7m \\ m^{2} - 7m + 12 &= 0 \\ (m-3)(m-4) &= 0, \end{align*} from which $m = 3$ or $m = 4$ .

The rest of the alternaters, however many there are, have the opposite behavior.
Consider the second question, ""Are you an alternater?"": The truth tellers again answer no, the liars falsely answer yes, and alternaters that truthfully answer also say yes.

From the first part, we know that $9$ alternaters lie here. From the previous part, we know that there are $6$ liars. Because only the number of truth tellers is unknown here, we can deduce that there are $22-9-6=7$ truth tellers.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of geometry and algebra. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - \( P \) lies on \( \overline{BC} \) such that \( \overline{AP} \) bisects \( \angle BAC \).
   - A line through \( B \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{AP} \).
   - A line through \( A \) is parallel to \( \overline{BC} \) and intersects the perpendicular line at \( D \).
   - Given \( BP = 2 \) and \( PC = 3 \), we need to find \( AD \).

2. **Using SymPy for Symbolic Computation:**
   - We will use symbolic variables for the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( P \).
   - We will use the properties of angle bisectors, parallel lines, and perpendicular lines to set up equations.
   - Finally, we will solve for \( AD \).

We also have $\triangle COM \sim \triangle CAP$ with ratio $3$ . Additionally, $\triangle BPN \sim \triangle ADN$ (with an unknown ratio). It is also true that $\triangle BAN \cong \triangle MAN$
Suppose the area of $\triangle COM$ is $x$ . Then, $[\triangle CAP] = 9x$ . Because $\triangle CAP$ and $\triangle BAP$ share the same height and have a base ratio of $3:2$ $[\triangle BAP] = 6x$ . Because $\triangle BOM$ and $\triangle COM$ share the same height and have a base ratio of $4:1$ $[\triangle BOM] = 4x$ $[\triangle BPN] = x$ , and thus $[OMNP] = 4x - x = 3x$ . Thus, $[\triangle MAN] = [\triangle BAN] = 5x$
Finally, we have $\frac{[\triangle BAN]}{[\triangle BPN]} = \frac{5x}{x} = 5$ , and because these triangles share the same height $\frac{AN}{PN} = 5$ . Notice that these side lengths are corresponding side lengths of the similar triangles $BPN$ and $ADN$ . This means that $AD = 5\cdot BP = \boxed{10}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of geometry and algebra. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - \( P \) lies on \( \overline{BC} \) such that \( \overline{AP} \) bisects \( \angle BAC \).
   - A line through \( B \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{AP} \).
   - A line through \( A \) is parallel to \( \overline{BC} \) and intersects the perpendicular line at \( D \).
   - Given \( BP = 2 \) and \( PC = 3 \), we need to find \( AD \).

2. **Using SymPy for Symbolic Computation:**
   - We will use symbolic variables for the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( P \).
   - We will use the properties of angle bisectors, parallel lines, and perpendicular lines to set up equations.
   - Finally, we will solve for \( AD \).

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the coordinates of points A, B, C, and P
Ax, Ay = sp.symbols('Ax Ay')
Bx, By = sp.symbols('Bx By')
Cx, Cy = sp.symbols('Cx Cy')
Px, Py = sp.symbols('Px Py')

# Given BP = 2 and PC = 3
BP = 2
PC = 3

# Point P lies on BC,","Let point $B$ be the origin, with $C$ being on the positive $x$ -axis and $A$ being in the first quadrant.
By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $AB:AC = 2:3$ . Thus, assume that $AB = 4$ , and $AC = 6$
Let the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$ be $AM$
Using Heron's formula, \[[ABC] = \sqrt{\frac{15}{2}\left(\frac{15}{2}-4\right)\left(\frac{15}{2}-5\right)\left(\frac{15}{2}-6\right)} = \frac{15}{4}\sqrt{7}.\]
Hence, \[AM = \frac{\frac{15}{4}\sqrt{7}}{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}.\]
Next, we have \[BM^2 + AM^2 = AB^2\] \[\therefore BM = \sqrt{16 - \frac{63}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \textrm{ and } PM = \frac{3}{2}.\]
The slope of line $AP$ is thus \[\frac{-\frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}}{\frac{3}{2}} = -\sqrt{7}.\]
Therefore, since the slopes of perpendicular lines have a product of $-1$ , the slope of line $BD$ is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}$ . This means that we can solve for the coordinates of $D$
\[y = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}\] \[y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}x\] \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}x = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}\] \[x = \frac{7 \cdot 3}{2} = \frac{21}{2}\] \[D = \left(\frac{21}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}\right).\]
We also know that the coordinates of $A$ are $\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}\right)$ , because $BM = \frac{1}{2}$ and $AM = \frac{3}{2}\sqrt{7}$
Since the $y$ -coordinates of $A$ and $D$ are the same, and their $x$ -coordinates differ by $10$ , the distance between them is $10$ . Our answer is $\boxed{10}.$"

  ","When we look at the side lengths of the quadrilateral we see $7$ and $24,$ which screams out $25$ because of Pythagorean triplets. As a result, we can draw a line through points $A$ and $C$ to make a diameter of $25.$ See Solution 1 for a rigorous proof.
This can also be shown using the Law of Cosines: Since $7^2+24^2-2\cdot7\cdot24\cdot\cos B=15^2+20^2-2\cdot15\cdot20\cdot\cos D$ and $\cos B + \cos D = 0,$ it follows that $\cos B = \cos D = 0.$
Since the diameter is $25,$ we can see the area of the circle is just $\frac{625\pi}{4}$ from the formula of the area of the circle with just a diameter.
Then we can use Brahmagupta Formula $\sqrt{(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)(s - d)}$ where $a,b,c,d$ are side lengths, and $s$ is semi-perimeter to find the area of the quadrilateral.
If we just plug the values in, we get $\sqrt{54756}=234.$ So now the area of the region we are trying to find is $\frac{625\pi}{4} - 234 = \frac{625\pi-936}{4}.$

(See Solution 1 for a proof.)
Next, we can choose one of these triangles and use the circumradius formula to find the radius. Let's choose the $15-20-25$ triangle. The area of the triangle is equal to the product of the side lengths divided by $4$ times the circumradius. Therefore, $150 = \frac{15\cdot20\cdot25}{4r}$ . Solving this simple algebraic equation gives us $r = \frac{25}{2}$
Plugging in the values, we have $\frac{25}{2}^2\cdot\pi - \left(\frac{15\cdot20}{2}+\frac{7\cdot24}{2}\right) = \frac{625\cdot\pi}{4} - 234$ . Rewriting this gives us $\frac{625\pi-936}{4}$
Therefore, adding these values gets us $\boxed{1565}.$"

","From the answer choices, we can assume the roots are rational numbers, and therefore this polynomial should be easily factorable.
The coefficients of $x$ must multiply to $10$ , so these coefficients must be $5,2,1$ or $10,1,$ in some order. We can try one at a time, and therefore write the factored form as follows: \[(5x-p)(2x-q)(x-r).\] Note that $p, q, r$ have to multiply to $6$ , so they must be either $3,2,1$ or $6,1,1$ in some order. Again, we can try one at a time in different positions and see if they multiply correctly.
We try $(5x-2)(2x-1)(x-3)$ and multiply the $x-$ terms, and sure enough they add up to $29$ . You can try to add up the $x^2$ terms and they add up to $-39$ . Therefore the roots are $\frac{2}{5}$ $\frac{1}{2}$ and $3$ . Now if you add $2$ to each root, you get the volume is $\frac{12}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{2} \cdot 5 = 6 \cdot 5 = 30 = \boxed{30}$"

Therefore, $p$ is $\pm (1, 2, 3, 6)$ and q is $\pm (1, 2, 5, 10).$
Doing Synthetic Division, we find that $3$ is a root of the cubic: \[\begin{array}{c|rrrr}&10&-39&29&-6\\3&&30&-27&6\\\hline\\&10&-9&2&0\\\end{array}.\]
Then, we have a quadratic $10x^2-9x+2.$ Using the Quadratic Formula, we can find the other two roots: \[x=\frac{9 \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2-4(10)(2)}}{2 \cdot 10},\] which simplifies to $x=\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{5}.$
To find the new volume, we add $2$ to each of the roots we found: \[(3+2)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2}+2\right)\cdot\left(\frac{2}{5}+2\right).\] Simplifying, we find that the new volume is $\boxed{30}.$"

Given:
\[ 0.\overline{abc} = \frac{1}{3} (0.\overline{a} + 0.\overline{b} + 0.\overline{c}) \]

First, let's express \(0.\overline{abc}\) and the repeating decimals \(0.\overline{a}\), \(0.\overline{b}\), and \(0.\overline{c}\) as fractions:

\[ 0.\overline{abc} = \frac{100a + 10b + c}{999} \]
\[ 0.\overline{a} = \frac{a}{9} \]
\[ 0.\overline{b} = \frac{b}{9} \]
\[ 0.\overline{c} = \frac{c}{9} \]

Substituting these into the given equation:

\[ \frac{100a + 10b + c}{999} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{a}{9} + \frac{b}{9} + \frac{c}{9} \right) \]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[ \frac","We rewrite the given equation, then rearrange: \begin{align*} \frac{100a+10b+c}{999} &= \frac13\left(\frac a9 + \frac b9 + \frac c9\right) \\ 100a+10b+c &= 37a + 37b + 37c \\ 63a &= 27b+36c \\ 7a &= 3b+4c. \end{align*} Now, this problem is equivalent to counting the ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ that satisfies the equation.
Clearly, the $9$ ordered triples $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1),(2,2,2),\ldots,(9,9,9)$ are solutions to this equation.
The expression $3b+4c$ has the same value when:
We find $4$ more solutions from the $9$ solutions above: $(a,b,c)=(4,8,1),(5,1,8),(5,9,2),(6,2,9).$ Note that all solutions are symmetric about $(a,b,c)=(5,5,5).$
Together, we have $9+4=\boxed{13}$ ordered triples $(a,b,c).$"

   - The reflection matrix across the \(y\)-axis is:
     \[
     R_{y-axis} = \begin{pmatrix}
     -1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Combining the transformations:**
   - The transformation \(T_k\) is the composition of \(R_k\) followed by \(R_{y-axis}\):
     \[
     T_k = R_{y-axis} \cdot R_k = \begin{pmatrix}
     -1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1
     \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
     \cos k & -\sin k \\
     \sin k & \cos k
     \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
     -\cos k & \sin k \\
     -\sin k & \cos k
    ","Note that since we're reflecting across the $y$ -axis, if the point ever makes it to $(-1,0)$ then it will flip back to the original point. Note that after $T_1$ the point will be $1$ degree clockwise from the negative $x$ -axis. Applying $T_2$ will rotate it to be $1$ degree counterclockwise from the negative $x$ -axis, and then flip it so that it is $1$ degree clockwise from the positive $x$ -axis. Therefore, after every $2$ transformations, the point rotates $1$ degree clockwise. To rotate it so that it will rotate $179$ degrees clockwise will require $179 \cdot 2 = 358$ transformations. Then finally on the last transformation, it will rotate on to $(-1,0)$ and then flip back to its original position. Therefore, the answer is $358+1 = 359 = \boxed{359}$"

1. **Rotation by \(k\) degrees counterclockwise around the origin:**
   - The rotation matrix for an angle \(k\) is:

Starting with $n=0$ , the sequence goes ${0}\rightarrow {179}\rightarrow {359}\rightarrow {178}\rightarrow {358}\rightarrow {177}\rightarrow {357}\rightarrow\cdots.$
We see that it takes $2$ steps to downgrade the point by $1^{\circ}$ . Since the $1$ st point in the sequence is ${179}$ , the answer is $1+2(179)=\boxed{359}.$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the unique integer \( h \) such that the sum of the reciprocals from 1 to 17 can be expressed as \( \frac{h}{L_{17}} \), where \( L_{17} \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers from 1 to 17. We then need to find the remainder when \( h \) is divided by 17.

Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the reciprocals from 1 to 17:**
   \[
   S = \sum_{k=1}^{17} \frac{1}{k}
   \]

2. **Express \( S \) in terms of the LCM:**
   \[
   S = \frac{h}{L_{17}}
   \]

3. **Find \( h \) such that \( S \) can be written in this form.**

4. **Compute \( h \) and find the remainder when \( h \) is divided by 17.**

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the range
n = 17

# Calculate the sum of reciprocals from 1 to n
S = sum(1/k for k in range(1, n + 1))

# Find the LCM of numbers from 1 to n
L_n = sp.lcm([k for k in range(1, n + 1)])

# Since S = h / L_n, we solve for h
h = S","Notice that $L_{17}$ contains the highest power of every prime below $17$ since higher primes cannot divide $L_{17}$ . Thus, $L_{17}=16\cdot 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17$
When writing the sum under a common fraction, we multiply the denominators by $L_{17}$ divided by each denominator. However, since $L_{17}$ is a multiple of $17$ , all terms will be a multiple of $17$ until we divide out $17$ , and the only term that will do this is $\frac{1}{17}$ . Thus, the remainder of all other terms when divided by $17$ will be $0$ , so the problem is essentially asking us what the remainder of $\frac{L_{17}}{17} = L_{16}$ divided by $17$ is. This is equivalent to finding the remainder of $16 \cdot 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ divided by $17$
We use modular arithmetic to simplify our answer:
This is congruent to $-1 \cdot 9 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \pmod{17}$
Evaluating, we get: \begin{align*} (-1) \cdot 9 \cdot 35 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 &\equiv (-1) \cdot 9 \cdot 1 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \pmod{17} \\ &\equiv 9 \cdot 11 \cdot (-13) \pmod{17} \\ &\equiv 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 4\pmod{17} \\ &\equiv 2 \cdot 11 \pmod{17} \\ &\equiv 5\pmod{17} \end{align*} Therefore the remainder is $\boxed{5}$"

The perimeter of the square bottom of the bowl is $4$ .
Halfway up the bowl, the boundary is still a square, with perimeter $4$ times the hexagon circumradius, aka $4 \times 2 = 8$ times the hexagon (also square) side length (1), an increase of $4$
Extending the bottom half of the bowl to twice its height (full height of the bowl) would increase the perimeter by the same amount again, forming a square with perimeter $4 + (8-4)\times 2= 12$ . Thus the top octagon is cut out of a square of side length $12\div4=3$ and thus area $9$
The difference  between the above-constructed square and the octagon is four right triangles, and (by rotational and reflection symmetry), each is isosceles with equal-length perpendicular bases of length $(3-1)/2 = 1$ , and thus having area $\frac12$ . Therefore the area of the octagon is $9-(4\times 1/2) = \boxed{7}$"

However, the other $4$ sides are touching the triangles, so we wish to find the length of these sides.
Notice that when two adjacent hexagons meet at a side, their planes make the same dihedral angle at the bottom-most point of intersection and at the top-most point of intersection by symmetry. Therefore, the triangle that is wedged between the two hexagons has the same angle as the square at the bottom wedged between the hexagons. Thus, the triangle is a $45-45-90$ isosceles triangle.
This conclusion can also be reached by cutting the bottom square across a diagonal and noticing that each resulting triangle is congruent to each triangle wedged between the hexagons by symmetry. 
Furthermore, notice that if you take a copy of this bowl and invert it and place it on top of this bowl, you will get a polyhedron with faces of hexagons and squares, a truncated octahedron, and therefore this triangle has a $90^\circ$ -angle:
Now that we have come to this conclusion, by simple Pythagorean theorem, we have that the other $4$ sides of the octagon are $\sqrt{2}$
We can draw a square around the octagon so that the area of the octagon is the area of the square minus each corner triangle. The hypotenuse of these corner triangles are $1$ and they are $45-45-90$ triangles because the octagon is equiangular, so each has dimensions $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},1$ . 
The side length of the square is $\sqrt{2}$ for the larger sides of the octagon, and adding $2$ of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ for each width of the triangle. Therefore, the area of the square is: \[\left(\sqrt{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 \implies \left(2\sqrt{2}\right)^2 = 8\] The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ and there are $4$ of them, so we subtract $1$ from the area of the square. The area of the octagon is thus $\boxed{7}$"

It is evident (may be not only for me) that projections of the coincide sides of hexagons  are along diagonals of $ABCD$ (for example $A, E, C,$ and $H$ are collinear.)
So the projections on $\pi$ of the coincide sides of hexagons and triangles are perpendicular to this lines $(SE \perp AE).$

Also note that if $m$ , which is the card that is numbered one more than $n$ , is placed before $n$ , then $m$ will not be picked up on the first pass since cards are picked up in order. Therefore we desire $m$ to be placed before $n$ to create a second pass, and that after the first pass, the numbers $m$ through $13$ are lined up in order from least to greatest.
To construct this, $n$ cannot go in the $n$ th position because all cards $1$ to $n-1$ will have to precede it and there will be no room for $m$ . Therefore $n$ must be in slots $n+1$ to $13$ .
Let's do casework on which slot $n$ goes into to get a general idea for how the problem works.
Case 1: With $n$ in spot $n+1$ , there are $n$ available slots before $n$ , and there are $n-1$ cards preceding $n$ . Therefore the number of ways to reserve these slots for the $n-1$ cards is $\binom{n}{n-1}$ . Then there is only $1$ way to order these cards (since we want them in increasing order). Then card $m$ goes into whatever slot is remaining, and the $13-m$ cards are ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$ , giving only $1$ way. Therefore in this case there are $\binom{n}{n-1}$ possibilities.
Case 2: With $n$ in spot $n+2$ , there are $n+1$ available slots before $n$ , and there are $n-1$ cards preceding $n$ . Therefore the number of ways to reserve slots for these cards are $\binom{n+1}{n-1}$ . Then there is one way to order these cards. Then cards $m$ and $m+1$ must go in the remaining two slots, and there is only one way to order them since they must be in increasing order. Finally, cards $m+2$ to $13$ will be ordered in increasing order after slot $n+1$ , which yields $1$ way. Therefore, this case has $\binom{n+1}{n-1}$ possibilities.
I think we can see a general pattern now. With $n$ in slot $x$ , there are $x-1$ slots to distribute to the previous $n-1$ cards, which can be done in $\binom{x-1}{n-1}$ ways. Then the remaining cards fill in in just $1$ way. Since the cases of $n$ start in slot $n+1$ and end in slot $13$ , this sum amounts to: \[\binom{n}{n-1}+\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \cdots + \binom{12}{n-1}\] for any $n$
Hmmm ... where have we seen this before?
We use wishful thinking to add a term of $\binom{n-1}{n-1}$ \[\binom{n-1}{n-1}+\binom{n}{n-1}+\binom{n+1}{n-1}+\binom{n+2}{n-1} + \cdots + \binom{12}{n-1}\]
This is just the hockey stick identity! Applying it, this expression is equal to $\binom{13}{n}$ . However, we added an extra term, so subtracting it off, the total number of ways to order the $13$ cards for any $n$ is \[\binom{13}{n}-1\]
Finally, to calculate the total for all $n$ , we sum from $n=0$ to $13$ . This yields us:
\[\sum_{n=0}^{13} \binom{13}{n}-1 \implies \sum_{n=0}^{13} \binom{13}{n} - \sum_{n=0}^{13} 1\] \[\implies 2^{13} - 14 = 8192 - 14 = 8178 = \boxed{8178}.\]"

Let $A_n$ be the number of arrangements for $n$ numbers. Now, let's look at how these arrangements are formed by case work on the first number $a_1$
If $a_1 = 1$ , the remaining $n-1$ numbers from $2$ to $n$ are arranged in the same way just like number 1 to $n-1$ in the case of $n-1$ numbers. So there are $A_{n-1}$ arrangements.
If $a_1 = 2$ , then we need to choose 1 position from position 2 to $n-1$ to put 1, and all remaining numbers must be arranged in increasing order, so there are $\binom{n-1}{1}$ such arrangements.
If $a_1 = k$ , then we need to choose $k-1$ positions from position 2 to $n-1$ to put $1, 2,\cdots k-1$ , and all remaining numbers must be arranged in increasing order, so there are $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ such arrangements.
So we can write \[A_n = A_{n-1} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-1}{2} + \cdots + \binom{n-1}{n-1}\] which can be simplified to \[A_n = A_{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1\] We can solve this recursive sequence by summing up $n-1$ lines of the recursive formula \[A_n - A_{n-1} = 2^{n-1} - 1\] \[A_{n-1} - A_{n-2} = 2^{n-2} - 1\] \[\cdots\] \[A_2 - A_{1} = 2^{1} - 1\] to get \[A_n - A_1 = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2^k - 1) = 2^n - 2 - (n-1) = 2^n - n - 1\] since $A_1=0$ , we have \[A_n = 2^n - n - 1\] and $A_{13} = 2^{13} - 14 = \boxed{8178}$"

After this process, exactly one spot will remain empty.
Then the strings of $n$ numbers between $0$ and $n-1$ that contain at least $k$ integers $<k$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$ are exactly the set of strings that leave spot $n$ empty. Also note for any string $c_1c_2 \ldots c_n$ , we can add $1$ to each $c_i$ (mod $n+1$ ) to shift the empty spot counterclockwise, meaning for each string there exists exactly one $j$ with $0 \leq j \leq n$ so that $(c_1+j)(c_2+j) \ldots (c_n+j)$ leaves spot $n$ empty.

These sets are of the form $\{a,a,b,b,b\}$ and $\{a,a,a,a,a\}$ .

$\textbf{(A) }336\qquad\textbf{(B) }337\qquad\textbf{(C) }338\qquad\textbf{(D) }","Let $r$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $R$ $s$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $S$ , and $t$ be the number of lattice points on the side length of square $T$ . Note that the actual lengths of the side lengths are the number of lattice points minus $1$ , so we can work in terms of $r, s, t$ and subtract $3$ to get the actual answer at the end. Furthermore, note that the number of lattice points inside a rectangular region is equal to the number of lattice points in its width times the number of lattice points along its length.
Using this fact, the number of lattice points in $R$ is $r^2$ , the number of lattice points in $S$ is $s^2$ , and the number of lattice points in $T$ is $t^2$
Now, by the first condition, we have \[r^2=\frac{9}{4}\cdot s^2 \implies r = \frac{3}{2}s     \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad (1)\]
The second condition, the number of lattice points contained in $T$ is a fourth of the number of lattice points contained in $R \cup S$ . The number of lattice points in $R \cup S$ is equal to the sum of the lattice points in their individually bounded regions, but the lattice points along the y-axis for the full length of square $S$ is shared by both of them, so we need to subtract that out.
In all, this condition yields us $t^2 = \frac{1}{4}\cdot(r^2 + s^2 - s )\implies t^2 = \frac{1}{4}\cdot\left(\frac{9}{4}\cdot s^2 + s^2 - s \right)$ $\implies t^2=\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{13s^2-4s}{4} \implies 16t^2= s(13s-4)$
Note from $(1)$ that $s$ is a multiple of $2$ . We can write $s=2j$ and substitute: $16t^2=2j(26j-4) \implies 4t^2=j(13j-2)$ .
Note that $j$ must be divisible by two for the product to be divisible by 4. Thus we make another substitution, $j=2k$ \[4t^2=2k(26k-2) \implies  t^2 = k(13k-1) \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad (2)\]
Finally we look at the last condition; that the fraction of the lattice points inside $S$ that are inside $S \cap T$ is $27$ times the fraction of lattice points inside $r$ that are inside $R \cap T$
Let $x$ be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the rectangle formed by $S \cap T$ , and $y$ be the number of lattice points along the bottom of the the rectangle formed by $R \cap T$
Therefore, the number of lattice points in $S\cap T$ is $xt$ and the number of lattice points in $R \cap T$ is $yt$
Thus by this condition, $\frac{xt}{s^2} = 27 \cdot \frac{yt}{r^2} \implies \frac{x}{s^2} = 27 \cdot \frac{y}{\frac{9}{4}\cdot s^2} \implies x= 12y$
Finally, notice that $t=x+y-1=12y+y-1$ (subtracting overlap), and so we have \[t=13y-1 \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad (3)\]
Now notice that by $(3)$ $t\equiv -1 \pmod{13}\implies t^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{13}$
However, by $(2)$ $t^2 \equiv k \cdot -1 \pmod{13}$ . Therefore, $-k \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \implies k \equiv -1 \pmod{13}$
Also, by $(2)$ , we know $k$ must be a perfect square since $k$ is relatively prime to $13k-1$ (Euclids algorithm) and the two must multiply to a perfect square. Hence we know two conditions on $k$ , and we can now guess and check to find the smallest that satisfies both.
We check $k=12$ first since its one less than a multiple of $13$ , but this does not work. Next, we have $k=25$ which works because $25$ is a perfect square. Thus we have found the smallest $k$ , and therefore the smallest $r, s, t$
Now we just work backwards: $j= 2k = 50$ and $s=2j=100$ . Then $r=\frac{3}{2}\cdot 100 = 150$ . Finally, from $(2)$ $t^2=25(13\cdot25-1) \implies t^2 = 25 \cdot 324 \implies t=5\cdot 18=90$
Finally, the sum of each square’s side lengths is $r+s+t-3=340-3=337=\boxed{337}$"

Then we have \[(r+1)^2=\dfrac{9}{4}(s+1)^2\ \ \ \ \ (t+1)^2=\dfrac{1}{4}((s+1)^2+(r+1)^2-(s+1))\] Therefore \[r=\dfrac{3s+1}{2}\ \ \ \ \ t=\dfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{(s+1)(13s+9)}-1\] Therefore \[r+s+t=\dfrac{3s+1}{2}+s+\dfrac{1}{4}\sqrt{(s+1)(13s+9)}-1\] \[\approx\dfrac{5}{2}s+\dfrac{\sqrt{13}}{4}s-\dfrac{1}{2}\approx 3.4\cdot s\]
Given that average of the answer choices is around $340$ , therefore $s\approx 100$ . Since $t$ is an integer, therefore $(s+1)(13s+9)$ must be a perfect square divisible by 16. Plugging in $s=99$ $t=89$ and $r=149$ . Therefore $r+s+t=99+89+149=337$ . So the answer is $\boxed{337}$"

The diagram is from as Solution 1,  but a line is constructed at $BD$
When it comes to the sides of a rhombus, their opposite sides are congruent and parallel. This means that $\angle ABD \cong \angle BDC$ , by the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem.
By SAS Congruence, we get $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle BDC$
Since $AP=3$ and $AB=5$ , we know that $BP=4$ because $\triangle APB$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle, as stated in Solution 1.
The area of $\triangle ABD$ would be $10$ , since the area of the triangle is $\frac{bh}{2}$
Since we know that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle BDC$ and that $ABCD=\triangle ABD + \triangle BDC$ , so we can double the area of $\triangle ADB$ to get $10 \cdot 2 = \boxed{20}$"

2. For each pair, calculate \( k = -(r_1 + r_2) \).

Let $k^2-144=n^2.$ Then, $(k+n)(k-n)=144.$ Since $k$ is an integer and $144$ is even, $k+n$ and $k-n$ must both be even. Assuming that $k$ is positive, we get $5$ possible values of $k+n$ , namely $2, 4, 8, 6, 12$ , which will give distinct positive values of $k$ , but $k+n=12$ gives $k+n=k-n$ and $n=0$ , giving $2$ identical integer roots.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the given sets contain exactly two multiples of 7. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Sets:**
   Each set contains 10 consecutive integers. For example, the first set is \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}\), the second set is \(\{11, 12, 13, \ldots, 20\}\), and so on up to the 100th set which is \(\{991, 992, 993, \ldots, 1000\}\).

2. **Identify Multiples of 7:**
   We need to find how many multiples of 7 are present in each set. For a set starting at \(a\), the multiples of 7 within the set are \(a + 0, a + 7, a + 14, \ldots\).

3. **Count the Multiples of 7 in Each Set:**
   We need to count how many multiples of 7 are there in each set and check if exactly two multiples of 7 are present in each set.

4. **Iterate Over All Sets:**
   We will iterate over all 100 sets and count how many of them contain exactly two multiples of 7.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check each set and count the required sets.

\]

We can simplify each term in the series:

\[
\frac{k}{(k+1)!} = \frac{k}{(k+1)k!} = \frac{1}{k!} - \frac{1}{(k+1)!}
\]

Thus, the sum \(S\) can be written as a telescoping series:

\[
S = \sum_{k=1}^{2021} \left( \frac{1}{k!} - \frac{1}{(k+1)!} \right)

Most terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
S = 1 - \frac{1}{2022!}

   Let the five integers be \(a, b, c, d, e\) in non-decreasing order.
   Let the median of these integers be \(M\).
   Let the mode be \(m\).

2. **Translate the Conditions:**
   - The unique mode \(m\) is 2 greater than the median \(M\): \(m = M + 2\).
   - The median \(M\) is 2 greater than the arithmetic mean: \(M = \frac{a + b + c + d + e}{5} + 2\).

3. **Formulate the Equations:**
   - Since \(M\) is the middle value when the integers are sorted: \(c = M\).
   - The mode \(m\) is the most frequently occurring value and must be \(M + 2\).

4. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - \(M = c\)
   - \(m = M + 2\)
   - \(M = \frac{a + b + M + d + e}{5} + 2\)

5. **Minimize the Mode:**
   We need to find the smallest possible value for \(m\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for the smallest possible value of \(m\).

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
a, b, c, d, e, M = sp.symbols('a b c d e M')

# Define the median
median_eq = sp.Eq(c, M","Let $M$ be the median. It follows that the two largest integers are both $M+2.$
Let $a$ and $b$ be the two smallest integers such that $a<b.$ The sorted list is \[a,b,M,M+2,M+2.\] Since the median is $2$ greater than their arithmetic mean, we have $\frac{a+b+M+(M+2)+(M+2)}{5}+2=M,$ or \[a+b+14=2M.\] Note that $a+b$ must be even. We minimize this sum so that the arithmetic mean, the median, and the unique mode are minimized. Let $a=1$ and $b=3,$ from which $M=9$ and $M+2=\boxed{11}.$"

For answer choice $\textbf{(A)},$ the mode is $5,$ the median is $3,$ and the arithmetic mean is $1.$ However, we can quickly see this doesn't work, as there are five integers, and they can't have an arithmetic mean of $1$ while having a mode of $5.$
Trying answer choice $\textbf{(B)},$ the mode is $7,$ the median is $5,$ and the arithmetic mean is $3.$ From the arithmetic mean, we know that all the numbers have to sum to $15.$ We know three of the numbers: $\underline{\hspace{3mm}},\underline{\hspace{3mm}},5,7,7.$ This exceeds the sum of $15.$
Now we try answer choice $\textbf{(C)}.$ The mode is $9,$ the median is $7,$ and the arithmetic mean is $5.$ From the arithmetic mean, we know that the list sums to $25.$ Three of the numbers are $\underline{\hspace{3mm}},\underline{\hspace{3mm}},7,9,9,$ which is exactly $25.$ However, our list needs positive integers, so this won't work.
Since we were really close on answer choice $\textbf{(C)},$ we can intuitively feel that the answer is probably going to be $\textbf{(D)}.$ We can confirm this by creating a list that satisfies the problem and choose $\textbf{(D)}: 1,3,9,11,11.$
So, our answer is $\boxed{11}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of rolls \( n \) such that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 at least once is greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \).

1. **Determine the probability of not rolling a sum of 7 in a single roll:**
   - Each die has 6 faces, so there are \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \) possible outcomes when rolling two dice.
   - We need to count the number of outcomes where the sum is not equal to 7.

2. **Calculate the probability of not rolling a sum of 7 in \( n \) rolls:**
   - If the probability of not rolling a sum of 7 in a single roll is \( P(\text{not 7}) \), then the probability of not rolling a sum of 7 in \( n \) rolls is \( P(\text{not 7})^n \).

3. **Set up the inequality to find the smallest \( n \) such that the probability of rolling a sum of 7 at least once is greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \):**
   - We need \( 1 - P(\text{not 7})^n > \frac{1}{2} \).
   - This simplifies to \( P(\text{not 7})^n < \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, we have $1-\left(\frac56\right)^n>\frac12,$ or \[\left(\frac56\right)^n<\frac12.\] Since $\left(\frac56\right)^4<\frac12<\left(\frac56\right)^3,$ the least integer $n$ satisfying the inequality is $\boxed{4}.$"

1. The positive difference between \( p \) and \( q \) is 2.
2. The positive difference between the cubes of \( p \) and \( q \) is 31106.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Set up the equations:**
   - \( |p - q| = 2 \)
   - \( |p^3 - q^3| = 31106 \)

2. **Express \( q \) in terms of \( p \):**
   Since \( |p - q| = 2 \), we can write \( q \) as either \( p + 2 \) or \( p - 2 \).

3. **Substitute \( q \) into the second equation and solve for \( p \):**
   - For \( q = p + 2 \):
     \[
     |p^3 - (p+2)^3| = 31106
     \]
   - For \( q = p - 2 \):
     \[
     |p^3 - (p-2)^3| = 31106
     \]

4. **Check if the resulting \( p \) is a prime number.**

5. **Calculate the sum of the digits of the least prime that is greater than those two primes.**

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the solution.

# Define the equations for the positive difference of cubes","Let the two primes be $a$ and $b$ . We would have $a-b=2$ and $a^{3}-b^{3}=31106$ . Using difference of cubes, we would have $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106$ . Since we know $a-b$ is equal to $2$ $(a-b)(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})$ would become $2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})=31106$ . Simplifying more, we would get $a^{2}+ab+b^{2}=15553$
Now let's introduce another variable. Instead of using $a$ and $b$ , we can express the primes as $x+2$ and $x$ where $a$ is $x+2$ and b is $x$ . Plugging $x$ and $x+2$ in, we would have $(x+2)^{2}+x(x+2)+x^{2}$ . When we expand the parenthesis, it would become $x^{2}+4x+4+x^{2}+2x+x^{2}$ . Then we combine like terms to get $3x^{2}+6x+4$ which equals $15553$ . Then we subtract 4 from both sides to get $3x^{2}+6x=15549$ . Since all three numbers are divisible by 3, we can divide by 3 to get $x^{2}+2x=5183$
Notice how if we add 1 to both sides, the left side would become a perfect square trinomial: $x^{2}+2x+1=5184$ which is $(x+1)^{2}=5184$ . Since $2$ is too small to be a valid number, the two primes must be odd, therefore $x+1$ is the number in the middle of them. Conveniently enough, $5184=72^{2}$ so the two numbers are $71$ and $73$ . The next prime number is $79$ , and $7+9=16$ so the answer is $\boxed{16}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum size of a subset \( S \) of the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 25\}\) such that the sum of any two elements (not necessarily distinct) from \( S \) is not an element of \( S \).

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding the Constraint:**
   The constraint is that for any two elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( S \), their sum \( a + b \) should not be in \( S \).

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - If we include both \( a \) and \( a + 1 \) in \( S \), then their sum \( 2a + 1 \) must not be in \( S \), which is impossible.
   - Therefore, we cannot include both \( a \) and \( a + 1 \) in \( S \).

3. **Pattern in Subsets:**
   - If we include an element \( a \), we cannot include \( a + 1 \). This implies that we can only include elements in \( S \) if they follow a specific pattern.

4. **Constructing the Largest Possible Subset:**
   - We need to find the largest subset where no two elements' sum is an element of the subset.

Let's implement this reasoning in Python using sympy to verify and find the maximum size of such a subset.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the set
full_set = set(range(1, 26))

# Function to check if a subset satisfies the condition

","Let $M$ be the largest number in $S$ .
We categorize numbers $\left\{ 1, 2, \ldots , M-1 \right\}$ (except $\frac{M}{2}$ if $M$ is even) into $\left\lfloor \frac{M-1}{2} \right\rfloor$ groups, such that the $i$ th group contains two numbers $i$ and $M-i$
Recall that $M \in S$ and the sum of two numbers in $S$ cannot be equal to $M$ , and the sum of numbers in each group above is equal to $S$ . Thus, each of the above $\left\lfloor \frac{M-1}{2} \right\rfloor$ groups can have at most one number in $S$ .
Therefore, \begin{align*} |S| & \leq 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{M-1}{2} \right\rfloor \\ & \leq 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{25}{2} \right\rfloor \\ & = 13. \end{align*}
Next, we construct an instance of $S$ with $|S| = 13$ .
Let $S = \left\{ 13, 14, \ldots , 25 \right\}$ .
Thus, this set is feasible.
Therefore, the most number of elements in $S$ is $\boxed{13}$"

But, how do we know we can't include even numbers for a higher element value? Well, to get a higher element value than $13$ , odd numbers as well as even numbers would have to be included in the list (since there are only $12$ even numbers from $1-25$ , and many of those even numbers are the sum of even numbers). However, for every even value we add to our odd list, we have to take away an odd number because there are either two odd numbers that sum to that even value, or that even value and another odd number will sum to an odd number later in the list.

To show that $S$ cannot have more than $13$ elements, assume for sake of contradiction that $|S| \geq 14$ . Let $S=\left\{ x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n \right\}$ where $n \geq 14$ and $x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_n$ . Because the sums of any $2$ (not necessarily distinct) elements do not appear in $S$ $x_1+x_i$ is not an element of $S$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$ . So, $x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n , x_1+x_1, x_1+x_2, \cdots , x_1+x_n$ are all distinct integers. Let these integers be elements of the set $T$ $|T|=2n$ , and because $n \geq 14$ $|T| \geq 28$ .

2. **Express \(S_{3n}\) and \(S_n\)**:
   - \(S_{3n} = \frac{3n}{2} (2a + (3n-1)d)\)
   - \(S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)\)

d = 2

# Sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence

Thus, the value of $S_{n}$ is $n(a + n - 1) = n^2 + n(a - 1)$ . Then, \[\frac{S_{3n}}{S_{n}} = \frac{9n^2 + 3n(a - 1)}{n^2 + n(a - 1)} = 9 - \frac{6n(a-1)}{n^2 + n(a-1)}.\] Of course, for this value to be constant, $6n(a-1)$ must be $0$ for all values of $n$ , and thus $a = 1$ .

There are $8$ possible equations:
Equation 1: $0 = 0$
Equation 2: $x = 0$
Equation 3: $y = 0$
Equation 4: $z = 0$
Equation 5: $x + y = 0$
Equation 6: $x + z = 0$
Equation 7: $y + z = 0$
Equation 8: $x + y + z = 0$
We will continue to refer to the equations by their number on this list.
$8^3 = 512$ total systems. Note that no two equations by themselves can force $x = y = z = 0$ . Therefore no system with Equation 1 or with repeated equations can force $x = y = z = 0$
Case 1: Equation 8 ( $x + y + z = 0$ ) is present.
Case 1a: Equation 8, and two equations from $\{5, 6, 7\}$
There are $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose two equations from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange each case. The number of options that force $x = y = z = 0$ is $3 \cdot 3! = 18$
Case 1b: Equation 8, one equation from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ , and one equation from $\{2, 3, 4\}$
There are $\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose one equation from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ . WLOG let us choose Equation 7. Given $x + y + z = 0$ and $y + z = 0$ , we conclude that $x = 0$ . The third equation can be either $y = 0$ or $z = 0$ . There are $3!$ ways to arrange each case. The number of options that force $x = y = z = 0$ is $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3! = 36$
Case 1c: Equation 8, and two equations from $\{2, 3, 4\}$
There are $\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to choose two equations from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ and $3! = 6$ ways to arrange each case. Each of these cases forces $x = y = z = 0$ $3 \cdot 3! = 18$ total options.
Case 2: Equation 8 is $\textbf{not}$ present, at least one equation from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ is present.
Case 2a: Equations $\{5, 6, 7\}$ are all present.
There are $3!$ ways to arrange the three equations. $6$ options.
Case 2b: Two equations from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ are present. One equation from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ is present.
There are $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to choose two equations from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ . WLOG let Equations 5 and 6 be in our system: $x + y = 0$ and $x + z = 0$ . Any equation from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ will force $x = y = z = 0$ . There are $3!$ ways to arrange the equations. The number of options that force $x = y = z = 0$ is $\binom{3}{2} \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot 3! = 54$
Case 2c: One equation from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ is present. Two equations from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ are present.
There are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to choose one equation from $\{5, 6, 7\}$ . WLOG let Equation 5 ( $x + y = 0$ ) be present. One of the two equations from $\{2, 3, 4\}$ must be Equation 4, $z = 0$ , since it is the only equation that restricts $z$ . The last equation can be either 2 or 3. There are $3!$ ways to arrange the equations. The number of options that force $x = y = z = 0$ is $\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{2}{1} \cdot 3! = 36$
Case 3: Only equations $\{2, 3, 4\}$ are present.
There are $3!$ ways to arrange the three equations. $6$ options.
We add up the cases: $18 + 36 + 18 + 6 + 54 + 36 + 6 = 174$ total systems force $x = y = z = 0$ . Thus $512 - 174 = \boxed{338}$ do not."

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to consider all possible systems of three linear equations with unknowns \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), where each coefficient is either 0 or 1. We are specifically interested in systems that have a nontrivial solution (i.e., \(x = y = z = 0\) is not the only solution).

Let's break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Generate All Possible Equations:**
   Each equation can have 3 coefficients (a, b, c) which can either be 0 or 1. This gives us \(2^3 = 8\) possible equations.

2. **Generate All Possible Systems of Three Equations:**
   From the 8 possible equations, we need to choose 3 to form a system. This can be done in \(\binom{8}{3}\) ways.

3. **Check for Nontrivial Solutions:**
   For each system of three equations, we need to check if it has a nontrivial solution (i","The total number of possible systems is $2^9 = 512$ , with $8$ possible sets of coefficients per equation. We will use complementary counting to find the number of systems which only have the solution $(0, 0, 0)$ and subtract that from the total. Similar to what is observed in Solution 2, if any equation is repeated or $0x + 0y + 0z = 0$ , there will only be two or fewer equations for three variables, making one unique solution impossible. Therefore, we must choose $3$ different equations from $7$ possible ones, giving $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 210$ systems. However, there are two exceptions to consider, which will have more than one solution. The first is of the form $x + y + z = 0$ $x + y = 0$ $z = 0$ ; the second is of the form $x = 0$ $y = 0$ $x + y = 0$ . In both cases, there are $3$ ways to choose the variables in the equations, and then $6$ ways to arrange them, giving $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 = 36$ exceptions. Subtracting this gives $210 - 36 = 174$ systems with only one solution, and the answer is then $512 - 174 = \boxed{338}$"

1. **Generate All Possible Equations:**

2. **Generate All Possible Systems of Three Equations:**
   From the 8 possible equations, we need to choose 3 to form a system. This can be done in \(\binom{8}{3}\) ways.

   For each system of three equations, we need to check if it has a nontrivial solution (i","Denote vector $\overrightarrow{i} = \left( i_1, i_2, i_3 \right)^T$ for $i \in \left\{ a, b, c \right\}$ .
Thus, we need to count how many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly dependent.
We do complementary counting.
First, the total number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $\left( 2^3 \right)^3 = 512$
Second, we count how many many vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ are linearly independent.
To meet this condition, no vector can be a zero vector $\overrightarrow{0} = \left( 0, 0, 0 \right)^T$
Next, we do the casework analysis.
Case $1^c$ : Three vectors are all on axes.
In this case, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ is $3!$
Case $2^c$ : Two vectors are on axes and the third vector is not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which two vectors lie on axes.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For two vectors selected in Step 1, we determine which two axes they lie on.
The number of ways is $3 \cdot 2$
Step 3: For the third unselected vector, we determine its value.
To make three vectors linear independent, the third vector cannot be on the plane formed by the first two vectors.
So the number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3$
Case $3^c$ : One vector is on an axis and the other two are not.
We construct such an instance in the following steps.
Step 1: We determine which vector lies on an axis.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 2: For the selected vector, we determine which axis it lies on.
The number of ways is $3$
Step 3: We determine the values of the two unselected vectors.
First, to be linearly independent, these two vectors are distinct.
Second, to be linearly independent, we cannot have one vector $(1,1,1)$ and another one that is a diagonal vector on the plane that is perpendicular to the first selected vector.
Thus, the number or ways in this step is $4 \cdot 3-2 = 10$
Following from the rule of product, the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10$
Case $(4.4)^c$ : No vector is on any axis.
In this case, any three distinct vectors are linearly independent.
So the number of $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ in this case is $4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$
Putting all cases together, the number of vector tuples $\left( \overrightarrow{a} , \overrightarrow{b} , \overrightarrow{c} \right)$ that are linearly independent is \[ 8^3 - 3!  - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 - 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 10 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = \boxed{338}. \] ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the geometry of the rhombus and the given conditions. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rhombus with \(\angle ADC = 46^\circ\).
   - \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{CD}\).
   - \(F\) is the point on \(\overline{BE}\) such that \(\overline{AF}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{BE}\).

2. **Properties of the Rhombus:**
   - All sides are equal.
   - Opposite angles are equal.
   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

3. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(CD\), \(E\) divides \(CD\) into two equal segments.
   - Since \(\angle ADC = 46^\circ\), the other angle \(\angle ABC = 134^\circ\) because the sum of angles in a rhombus is \(360^\circ\).

4. **Perpendicular Condition:**
   - \(\overline{AF}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{BE}\), which means \(\angle AFE = 90^\circ\).

5. **Objective:**
   - Find the measure of \(\angle BFC\).

Let's use Python and SymPy to solve this geometrically.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the symbols
A, B, C, D = sp.symbols('A B C D')
E = sp.symbols('E')
F = sp.symbols('F')

# Define","Without loss of generality, we assume the length of each side of $ABCD$ is $2$ .
Because $E$ is the midpoint of $CD$ $CE = 1$
Because $ABCD$ is a rhombus, $\angle BCE = 180^\circ - \angle D$
In $\triangle BCE$ , following from the law of sines, \[ \frac{CE}{\sin \angle FBC} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BEC} . \]
We have $\angle BEC = 180^\circ - \angle FBC - \angle BCE = 46^\circ - \angle FBC$
Hence, \[ \frac{1}{\sin \angle FBC} = \frac{2}{\sin \left( 46^\circ - \angle FBC \right)} . \]
By solving this equation, we get $\tan \angle FBC = \frac{\sin 46^\circ}{2 + \cos 46^\circ}$
Because $AF \perp BF$ \begin{align*} BF & = AB \cos \angle ABF \\ & = 2 \cos \left( 46^\circ - \angle FBC \right) . \end{align*}
In $\triangle BFC$ , following from the law of sines, \[ \frac{BF}{\sin \angle BCF} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BFC} . \]
Because $\angle BCF = 180^\circ - \angle BFC - \angle FBC$ , the equation above can be converted as \[ \frac{BF}{\sin \left( \angle BFC + \angle FBC \right)} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BFC} . \]
Therefore, \begin{align*} \tan \angle BFC & = \frac{\sin \angle FBC}{\cos \left( 46^\circ - \angle FBC \right) - \cos \angle FBC} \\ & = \frac{1}{\sin 46^\circ - \left( 1 - \cos 46^\circ \right) \cot \angle FBC} \\ & = \frac{\sin 46^\circ}{\cos 46^\circ - 1} \\ & = - \frac{\sin 134^\circ}{1 + \cos 134^\circ} \\ & = - \tan \frac{134^\circ}{2} \\ & = - \tan 67^\circ \\ & = \tan \left( 180^\circ - 67^\circ \right) \\ & = \tan 113^\circ . \end{align*}
Therefore, $\angle BFC = \boxed{113}$"

Now, $\overline{AF} \perp \overline{BE}$ , so $\triangle GFA$ is right and median $FD = AD$
So now, because $ABCD$ is a rhombus, $FD = AD = CD$ . This means that there exists a circle from $D$ with radius $AD$ that passes through $F$ $A$ , and $C$
AG is a diameter of this circle because $\angle AFG=90^\circ$ . This means that $\angle GFC = \angle GAC = \frac{1}{2} \angle GDC$ , so $\angle GFC = \frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - 46^\circ)=67^\circ$ , which means that $\angle BFC = \boxed{113}$"

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rhombus with \(\angle ADC = 46^\circ\).
   - \(E\) is the midpoint of \(\overline{CD}\).
   - \(F\) is the point on \(\overline{BE}\) such that \(\overline{AF}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{BE}\).

2. **Properties of the Rhombus:**
   - All sides are equal.
   - Opposite angles are equal.
   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

3. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(CD\), \(E\) divides \(CD\) into two equal segments.
   - Since \(\angle ADC = 46^\circ\), the other angle \(\angle ABC = 134^\circ\) because the sum of angles in a rhombus is \(360^\circ\).

4. **Perpendicular Condition:**
   - \(\overline{AF}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{BE}\), which means \(\angle AFE = 90^\circ\).

5. **Objective:**
   - Find the measure of \(\angle BFC\).

# Define","If angle $ADC$ was a right angle, it would be much easier. Thus, first pretend that $ADC$ is a right angle. $ABCD$ is now a square. WLOG, let each of the side lengths be 1. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of line $AE$ , which is $\sqrt{5}/2$ . We want the measure of angle $BFC$ , so to work closer to it, we should try finding the length of line $BF$ . Angle $FAB$ and angle $ABF$ are complementary. Angle $ABF$ and angle $FBC$ are also complementary. Thus, $\sin FAB=\cos ABF=\sin FBC$ $\sin FAB=\sin FBC=(1/2)/(\sqrt{5}/2)=1/\sqrt{5}$ . Since $\sin FAB=1\sqrt{5}$ ,and $AB=1$ $FB=\sin FAB$ . It follows now that $FE=3*\sqrt{5}/10$
Now, zoom in on triangle $BEC$ . To use the Law of Cosines on triangle $FBC$ , we need the length of $FC$ . Use the Law of Cosines on triangle $EFC$ . Cos $E=1/\sqrt{5}$ . Thus, after using the Law of Cosines, $FC=\sqrt{2/5}$
Since we now have SSS on $BEC$ , we can get use the Law of Cosines. $\cos BFC=1/-\sqrt{2}$ $\arccos 1/-\sqrt{2}$ is 45, but if the cosine is negative that means that the angle is the supplement of the positive cosine value. $180-45=135$ . Angle $BFC$ is $135^\circ$
Realize that, around point F, there will always be 3 right angles, regardless of what angle $ADC$ is. There are only two angles that change when $ADC$ changes. Break up angle $BFC$ into angle $BFB'$ , which is always 90 degrees, and angle $B'FC$ , which we have discovered to to be half of $ADC$ . Thus, when angle $ADC$ is 46 degrees, then $B'FC$ will be 23. $23+90=113$ . Angle $BFC$ is $\boxed{113}$ degrees."

Also $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1$
We infer that $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ have same degree, we can assume $Q_1(x) = x + a$ , and $Q_2(x) = x + b$ , since $P(x)$ has least degree. If this cannot work, we will try quadratic, etc.
Then we get: $(x^2+1)(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$
The constant term gives us: $(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + 1 = 0$
So $Q_1(x) - Q_2(x) = -1$
Substituting this in gives: $-(x^2+1) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$
Solving this equation, we get $Q_1(x) = x + 1$

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find a polynomial \( P(x) \) that satisfies the given conditions:

1. When \( P(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 + x + 1 \), the remainder is \( x + 2 \).
2. When \( P(x) \) is divided by \( x^2 + 1 \), the remainder is \( 2x + 1 \).

We can express \( P(x) \) as:
\[ P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(ax + b) + (x + 2) \]
\[ P(x) = (x^2 + 1)(cx + d) + (2x + 1) \]

Here, \( P(x) \) is a polynomial of degree at most 3. Let's denote it as:
\[ P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \]

We will use the conditions to form a system of equations and solve for the coefficients \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Let's start by expanding the given forms and equating coefficients:

1. \( P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1)(ax + b) + (x + 2) \)
\[ P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + ax + b + x + 2 \]
\[ P(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + (a+1)x + (b+2) \]

2. \( P","Notice that we cannot have the quotients equal to some constants, since the same constant will yield different constant terms for $P(x)$ (which is bad) and different constants will yield different first coefficients (also bad). Thus, we try setting the quotients equal to linear terms (for minimizing degree).
Let $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+(x+2)$ and $P(x)=(x^2+1)(ax+c)+(2x+1)$ . The quotients have the same $x$ coefficient, since $P(x)$ must have the same $x^3$ coefficient in both cases. Expanding, we get \[P(x)=ax^3+(a+b)x^2+(a+b+1)x+(b+2)\] and \[P(x)=ax^3+cx^2+(a+2)x+(c+1).\]
Equating coefficients, we get $b+2=c+1$ $a+b+1=a+2$ , and $a+b=c$ . From the second equation, we get $b=1$ , then substituting into         the first, $c=2$ . Finally, from $a+b=c$ , we have $a=1$ . Now, $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+(x+2)=(x^2+x+1)(x+1)+(x+2)=x^3+2x^2+3x+3$ and our answer is \[1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\boxed{23}.\]"

Let $Q(x)=x-q$ and $R(x)=x-r.$ We know there will be values for $q$ and $r$ that make the below equation hold, so we can assume that $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$
Substituting these values in, and setting $\textbf{(1)}$ and $\textbf{(2)}$ equal to each  other, \[(x^2+x+1)(x-q)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\] We plug in $x=0$ , yielding $r+1=q.$ Substituting this value into the above equation, \[(x^2+x+1)(x-r-1)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\] Letting $x=1,$ we conclude that $r=-2,$ so $R(x)=x+2.$ Therefore, \[P(x)=(x^2+1)(x+2)+2x+1 = x^3+2x^3+3x+3.\] The requested sum is \[1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\boxed{23}\]"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the set of circles \( S \) that are tangent to the three given circles:

1. \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \)
3. \( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \)

Let's denote the centers and radii of these circles:
- Circle 1: Center \((0,0)\), Radius \(2\)
- Circle 2: Center \((0,0)\), Radius \(8\)
- Circle 3: Center \((5,0)\), Radius \(\sqrt{3}\)

We need to find circles that are tangent to all three circles. For a circle to be tangent to another circle, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum (external tangency) or difference (internal tangency) of their radii.

Let's denote the circle in set \( S \) as \( (x, y) \) with radius \( r \).

The distance between the centers of circle 1 and circle 2 is 8 units.
The distance between the centers of circle 1 and circle 3 is 5 units.
The distance between the centers of circle 2 and circle 3 is \(\sqrt{67}\) units.

We need to find the circles that are tangent to all three circles. This implies:
- The distance from the center of the circle to \((0,0)\) must be \(2 + r\) or \(8 - r\).
- The distance from the center of the circle to \((0,0)\) must be \(2 + r","We denote by $C_1$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ .
We denote by $C_2$ the circle that has the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$ .
We denote by $C_3$ the circle that has the equation $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3$
We denote by $C_0$ a circle that is tangent to $C_1$ $C_2$ and $C_3$ .
We denote by $\left( u, v \right)$ the coordinates of circle $C_0$ , and $r$ the radius of this circle.
From the graphs of circles $C_1$ $C_2$ $C_3$ , we observe that if $C_0$ is tangent to all of them, then $C_0$ must be internally tangent to $C_2$ .
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( 8 - r \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
We do the following casework analysis in terms of the whether $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
Case 1: $C_0$ is externally tangent to $C_1$ and $C_3$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2   \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r + 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 3$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 2: $C_1$ is internally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is externally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r - 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r + \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]
Taking $(2) - (1)$ , we get $r - 2 = 8 - r$ . Thus, $r = 5$ .
We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Case 3: $C_1$ is externally tangent to $C_0$ and $C_3$ is internally tangent to $C_0$
We have \[ u^2 + v^2 = \left( r + 2 \right)^2  \hspace{1cm} (2) \] and \[ (u-5)^2 + v^2 = \left( r - \sqrt{3} \right)^2 . \hspace{1cm} (3) \]

We can further compute (omitted here) that there exist feasible $(u,v)$ with this given $r$
Because the graph is symmetric with the $x$ -axis, and for each case above, the solution of $v$ is not 0. Hence, in each case, there are two congruent circles whose centers are symmetric through the $x$ -axis.

2. \( f(300) = f(900) \)

We need to determine the greatest possible value of \( f(f(800)) - f(f(400)) \).

First, let's analyze the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Lipschitz Condition**:
   The first condition \( |f(x) - f(y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} |x - y| \) tells us that \( f \) is a Lipschitz continuous function with a Lipschitz constant of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Equality Condition**:

### Function Formulation

Given the Lipschitz condition and the equality condition, we can hypothesize that \( f \) could be a piecewise linear function with a periodic component. Let's assume:
\[ f(x) = kx + c \]

Given \( f(300) = f(900) \):

Then $f(400) = c - 50$ and $f(800) = c + 50$ , so $|f(800) - f(400)| = |c + 50 - (c - 50)| = 100$ , and this is attainable because the slope of the line connecting $f(400)$ and $f(800)$ still has absolute value less than $\frac{1}{2}$
Therefore, $|f(f(800)) - f(f(400))| \leq \frac{1}{2}|f(800) - f(400)| = \frac{1}{2}(100) = \boxed{50}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find functions \( f \) that satisfy the given conditions:

1. \( |f(x) - f(y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} |x - y| \)
2. \( f(300) = f(900) \)

We need to determine the greatest possible value of \( f(f(800)) - f(f(400)) \).

First, let's analyze the given conditions.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Lipschitz Condition**:
   The first condition \( |f(x) - f(y)| \leq \frac{1}{2} |x - y| \) tells us that \( f \) is a Lipschitz continuous function with a Lipschitz constant of \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Equality Condition**:
   The second condition \( f(300) = f(900) \) implies that \( f \) has a periodic component since \( |300 - 900| = 600 \) and \( f \) maps both 300 and 900 to the same value.

### Function Formulation

Given the Lipschitz condition and the equality condition, we can hypothesize that \( f \) could be a piecewise linear function with a periodic component. Let's assume:
\[ f(x) = kx + c \]

Given \( f(300) = f(900) \):
\[ 300k + c = 900k + c \]
This implies:
\[ 6","Consider $g(x) = f(x)-f(300)$ . Then $g(x)$ satisfies all the conditions and $g(300) = g(900) = 0$ . We would want $g(400)$ and $g(800)$ as distant from each other as possible. So assign $g(400) = -50$ and $g(800) = 50$ , the possible lower and upper bounds respectively. It follows that one can obtain the upper bound for $|g(g(800)) - g(g(400))| = |g(50) - g(-50  )| \leq \frac{1}{2}(100) = \boxed{50}$ as the answer."

### Solution: To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to assist with the calculations.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are given a sequence \( x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots \) where each \( x_k \) is either 0 or 1.
   We are also given the condition \( 7S_n \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n} \) for all \( n \geq 1 \),

Starting with $2019$ \begin{align*} 7S_{2019} &\equiv 1 \pmod{2^{2019}} \\ 7S_{2019} &= 2^{2019}k + 1. \end{align*} Now, take both sides $\operatorname{mod} \ 7$ \[0 \equiv 2^{2019}k + 1 \pmod{7}.\] Using Fermat's Little Theorem, \[2^{2019} = (2^{336})^6 \cdot 2^3 \equiv 2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.\] Thus, \[0 \equiv k + 1 \pmod{7} \implies k \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \implies k = 7j + 6.\] Therefore, \[7S_{2019} = 2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1 \implies S_{2019} = \frac{2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1}{7}.\]
We may repeat this same calculation with $S_{2023}$ to yield \[S_{2023} = \frac{2^{2023} (7h + 3) + 1}{7}.\] Now, we notice that $S_n$ is basically an integer expressed in binary form with $n$ bits.
This gives rise to a simple inequality, \[0 \leqslant S_n \leqslant 2^n.\] Since the maximum possible number that can be generated with $n$ bits is \[\underbrace{{11111\dotsc1}_2}_{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = 2^n - 1 \leqslant 2^n.\] Looking at our calculations for $S_{2019}$ and $S_{2023}$ , we see that the only valid integers that satisfy that constraint are $j = h = 0$ \[\frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} = \frac{\tfrac{2^{2023} \cdot 3 + 1}{7} - \tfrac{2^{2019} \cdot 6 + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} = \frac{2^4 \cdot 3 - 6}{7} = \boxed{6}.\] ~zoomanTV"

Even when this happens, the value of $S_n$ is less than $2^n$ . Therefore, we can construct the following inequalities: \[\textbf{(3) } S_{2023}=\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1}{7} < 2^{2023},\] \[\textbf{(4) } S_{2019}=\frac{2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1}{7} < 2^{2019}.\] From these two equations, we can deduce that both $x$ and $y$ are less than $7$
Reducing $\textbf{1}$ and $\textbf{2}$ $\pmod{7},$ we see that \[2^{2023}\cdot{x}\equiv 6\pmod{7},\] and \[2^{2019}\cdot{y}\equiv 6\pmod{7}.\]
The powers of $2$ repeat every $3, \pmod{7}.$
Therefore, $2^{2023}\equiv 2 \pmod 7$ and $2^{2019} \equiv 1 \pmod {7}.$ Substituing this back into the above equations, \[2x\equiv{6}\pmod{7}\] and \[y\equiv{6}\pmod{7}.\]
Since $x$ and $y$ are integers less than $7$ , the only values of $x$ and $y$ are $3$ and $6$ respectively.
The requested sum is \begin{align*} \frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} &= \frac{\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{x} + 1}{7} - \frac{2^{2019}\cdot{y} + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} \\ &= \frac{1}{2^{2019}}\left(\frac{2^{2023}\cdot{3} + 1}{7} -\left(\frac{2^{2019}\cdot{6} + 1}{7}  \right)\right) \\ &= \frac{3\cdot{2^4}-6}{7} \\ &= \boxed{6} -Benedict T (countmath1)"

Substituting, we get \[7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \frac{(1 + 2^{2019} * 16a) - (1 + 2^{2019}b)}{2^{2019}} = 16a - b.\] Therefore, our answer can be written as \[\frac{16a - b}{7}.\] Another thing to notice is that a and b are integers between 0 and 6. This is because \[7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \cdots + 2^{2022}) \geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a\] which is \[7(2^{2023}) - 7 \geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a\] \[(7-a) \geqslant \frac{8}{2^{2023}}\] which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\] which would mean \[S_{2023} < 0\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0.  A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive.
Going back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then \[16a - b = 7n\] and \[16a = 7n + b,\] so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{6}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the index card after modifying it and then calculate the area based on the given conditions.

1. **Initial Dimensions:**
   The initial dimensions of the index card are \(4\) inches by \(6\) inches.

2. **Shortening One Side:**
   - If one side is shortened by \(1\) inch and the area becomes \(18\) square inches, we need to determine which side was shortened.

3. **Calculate Possible Dimensions:**
   - If the width (4 inches) is shortened by 1 inch, the new dimensions will be \(3\) inches by \(6\) inches.
   - If the length (6 inches) is shortened by 1 inch, the new dimensions will be \(4\) inches by \(5\) inches.

4. **Check Which Case Matches the Given Area:**
   - Calculate the area for each case and check if it matches \(18\) square inches.

5. **Calculate the Area When the Other Side is Shortened by 1 Inch:**
   - Once we identify the correct case, we will then shorten the other side by \(1\) inch and calculate the new area.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for the correct dimensions and calculate the area.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the initial dimensions
initial_width = 4
initial_length = 6

# Define the shortened dimensions and area
shortened_width_case1 = 3
shortened_length_case1 = 6
area_case1 = shortened_width_case1 * shortened_length_case1

shortened_width_case2 = 4

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of spherical balls of clay, each with a radius of 2, that can fit into a cube with a side length of 6. 

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube:**
   The side length of the cube is given as 6. The volume of the cube \( V_{\text{cube}} \) is calculated as:
   \[
   V_{\text{cube}} = 6^3
   \]

2. **Calculate the Volume of a Spherical Ball:**
   The radius of each spherical ball is 2. The volume of a sphere \( V_{\text{sphere}} \) is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (2)^3
   \]

3. **Determine the Number of Spheres that Fit:**
   Since the balls can be reshaped but not compressed, the total volume of the reshaped balls must not exceed the volume of the cube. The maximum number of spheres that can fit is given by:
   \[
   \text{Number of spheres} = \left\lfloor \frac{V_{\text{cube}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} \right\rfloor
   \]

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accurate calculations.

#","The volume of the cube is $V_{\text{cube}}=6^3=216,$ and the volume of a clay ball is $V_{\text{ball}}=\frac43\cdot\pi\cdot2^3=\frac{32}{3}\pi.$

Thus, the value of \( A \) is \(\boxed{9}\).
","First, modulo $2$ or $5$ $\underline{20210A} \equiv A$ .
Hence, $A \neq 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8$
Second modulo $3$ $\underline{20210A} \equiv 2 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + A \equiv 5 + A$ .
Hence, $A \neq 1, 4, 7$

Hence, $A \neq 3$

1. **Calculate the distance between consecutive poles:**
   - There are 41 poles, and the total distance from the first to the 41st pole is 5280 feet.
   - Therefore, the number of gaps between the poles is \(41 - 1 = 40\).

2. **Determine the length of each stride and each leap:**
   - Elmer takes 44 strides to cover the distance between two poles.
   - Oscar takes 12 leaps to cover the same distance.

3. **Calculate the length of each stride and each leap:**
   - The length of Elmer's stride is the total distance divided by the number of strides.
   - The length of Oscar's leap is the total distance divided by the number of leaps.

4. **Find the difference in length between Oscar's leap and Elmer's stride.**

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy:

```python

total_distance = 5280

# Number of gaps between poles (number of poles - 1)
num_gaps = 40

# Number of strides and leaps
elmer_strides = 44
oscar_leaps = 12

# Calculate the length of each stride and each leap
elmer_stride_length = total_distance / num_","There are $41-1=40$ gaps between the $41$ telephone poles, so the distance of each gap is $5280\div40=132$ feet.
Each of Oscar's leaps covers $132\div12=11$ feet, and each of Elmer's strides covers $132\div44=3$ feet.
Therefore, Oscar's leap is $11-3=\boxed{8}$ feet longer than Elmer's stride."

### Solution: To determine how many two-digit positive integers are ""cuddly,"" we need to identify numbers that satisfy the condition of being equal to the sum of their nonzero tens digit and the square of their units digit.

Let's denote a two-digit number as \(10a + b\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the units digit. The problem states that:
\[ 10a + b = a + b^2 \]

Rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving \(b\):
\[ 10a + b - a = b^2 \]
\[ 9a + b = b^2 \]
\[ b^2 - b = 9a \]

Now, we need to check for which values of \(a\) and \(b\) this equation holds true, where \(a\) is a digit from 1 to 9 (since the number is two-digit) and \(b\) is a digit from 0 to 9.

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to calculate two values: \( t \) and \( s \).

1. **Calculate \( t \)**:
   \( t \) is the average number of students in a randomly chosen teacher's class. This is the mean of the enrollments:
   \[
   t = \frac{50 + 20 + 20 + 5 + 5}{5}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( s \)**:
   \( s \) is the average number of students in a randomly chosen student's class. This is the weighted mean of the enrollments:
   \[
   s = \frac{\sum (\text{number of students in each class} \times \text{proportion of students in that class})}{\text{total number of students}}
   \]
   The proportion of students in each class is given by the enrollments divided by the total number of students (100).

Let's calculate these values using Python and sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the enrollments
enrollments = [50, 20, 20, 5, 5]

# Calculate t: average number of students in a teacher's class
t = sum(enrollments) / len(enrollments)

# Calculate s: average number of students in a student's class
total_students = 100
s","The formula for expected values is \[\text{Expected Value}=\sum(\text{Outcome}\cdot\text{Probability}).\] We have \begin{align*} t &= 50\cdot\frac15 + 20\cdot\frac15 + 20\cdot\frac15 + 5\cdot\frac15 + 5\cdot\frac15 \\ &= (50+20+20+5+5)\cdot\frac15 \\ &= 100\cdot\frac15 \\ &= 20, \\ s &= 50\cdot\frac{50}{100} + 20\cdot\frac{20}{100} + 20\cdot\frac{20}{100} + 5\cdot\frac{5}{100} + 5\cdot\frac{5}{100} \\ &= 25 + 4 + 4 + 0.25 + 0.25 \\ &= 33.5. \end{align*} Therefore, the answer is $t-s=\boxed{13.5}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the length of the ship in terms of Emily's steps.

Let's denote:

- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_e \) as Emily's speed.
- \( d \) as the distance between Emily and the ship when she starts walking from the back of the ship.

Given:

Then, in the time that Emily walks $210$ steps, the ship moves $210-x$ steps.
Also, in the time that Emily walks $42$ steps, the ship moves $x-42$ steps.
Since the ship and Emily have the same ratio of absolute speeds in either direction, $\frac{210}{210-x} = \frac{42}{x-42}$ . Dividing both sides by $42$ and cross multiplying, we get $5(x-42) = 210-x$ , so $6x = 420$ , and $x = \boxed{70}$"

Taking Emily's step as a unit of distance, we now have two equations \begin{align*} 210 &= x + 210 s, \\ 42 &= x - 42s. \end{align*} Solving for $x$ you get $\boxed{70}$"

$\textbf{(A) }70\qquad\textbf{(B) }84\qquad\textbf{(C) }98\qquad\textbf{(D) }105\qquad\textbf{(E) }126$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the length of the ship in terms of Emily's steps.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the ship (in terms of Emily's steps).
- \( v_s \) as the speed of the ship.
- \( v_e \) as Emily's speed.
- \( d \) as the distance between Emily and the ship when she starts walking from the back of the ship.

Given:
1. Emily walks from the back to the front of the ship: \(210\) steps.
2. Emily walks from the front to the back of the ship: \(42\) steps.

We can set up the following equations based on the distances and speeds:

1. When Emily walks from the back to the front:
\[ 210 = d + L \]

2. When Emily walks from the front to the back:
\[ 42 = d - L \]

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \( L \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
L, d = sp.symbols('L d')

# Define the equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = sp.Eq(210, d + L)
eq2 = sp.Eq(42, d - L)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (L, d))

# Extract the length of","Call the speed of the boat $v_s$ and the speed of Emily $v_e$
Consider the scenario when Emily is walking along with the boat. Relative to an observer on the boat, her speed is $v_e-v_s$
Consider the scenario when Emily is walking in the opposite direction. Relative to an observer on the boat, her speed is $v_e+v_s$
Since Emily takes $210$ steps to walk along with the boat and $42$ steps to walk opposite the boat, that means it takes her $5$ times longer to walk the length of a stationary boat at $v_e-v_s$ compared to $v_e+v_s$
This means that $5(v_e-v_s)=v_e+v_s$ , so $v_s = \frac{2v_e}{3}$
As Emily takes $210$ steps to walk the length of the boat at a speed of $v_e- \frac{2v_e}{3}=\frac{v_e}{3}$ , she must take $\frac13$ of the time to walk the length of the boat at a speed of $v_e$ , so our answer is $\frac{210}{3} = \boxed{70}$"

### Solution: To solve the given system of equations for the number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) of real numbers that satisfy both equations, we need to analyze and solve them step-by-step.

The system of equations is:
\[
x^2 + 3y = 9
\]
\[
(|x| + |y| - 4)^2 = 1
\]

First, let's simplify the second equation:
\[
(|x| + |y| - 4)^2 = 1
\]
Taking the square root on both sides, we get two cases:
\[
|x| + |y| - 4 = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad |x| + |y| - 4 = -1
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
|x| + |y| = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad |x| + |y| = 3
\]

Now, we need to solve the system:
\[
x^2 + 3y = 9
\]
for each of the following cases:
1. \(|x| + |y| = 5\)
2. \(|x| + |y| = 3\)

Since \(|x|\) and \(|y|\) can be both positive and negative, we need to consider all combinations for each case.

Let's solve these using Python and SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

- The pillars are at the vertices of a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\).
- The heights of the pillars at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are 12 meters, 9 meters, and 10 meters respectively.

   - The vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are placed at equal distances from each other.

2. **Establish a Coordinate System:**

   - The coordinates of \(B\) and \(C\) can be determined based on the geometry of the hexagon.

3. **Find the Equation of the Plane:**
   - Use the heights of the pillars at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) to find the equation of the plane that the solar panel forms.

4. **Determine the Height at \(E\):**
   - Use the equation of the plane to find the height at the vertex \(E\).","The pillar at $B$ has height $9$ and the pillar at $A$ has height $12.$ Since the solar panel is flat, the inclination from pillar $B$ to pillar $A$ is $3.$ Call the center of the hexagon $G.$ Since $\overrightarrow{CG}\parallel\overrightarrow{BA},$ it follows that the solar panel has height $13$ at $G.$ Since the solar panel is flat, the heights of the solar panel at $B,G,$ and $E$ are collinear.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand the 3D structure formed by the pillars and the solar panel. Since the solar panel is not parallel to the ground, it will form a plane that intersects the pillars at different heights. 

Given:
- The pillars are at the vertices of a regular hexagon \(ABCDEF\).
- The heights of the pillars at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are 12 meters, 9 meters, and 10 meters respectively.

We need to find the height of the pillar at \(E\).

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
   - The vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) are placed at equal distances from each other.

2. **Establish a Coordinate System:**
   - Place the hexagon in a 3D coordinate system with \(A\) at the origin \((0, 0, 0)\).
   - The coordinates of \(B\) and \(C\) can be determined based on the geometry of the hexagon.

3. **Find the Equation of the Plane:**
   - Use the heights of the pillars at \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) to find the equation of the plane that the solar panel forms.

4. **Determine the Height at \(E\):**
   - Use the equation of the plane to find the height at the vertex \(E\).","Because the three points given are integers, it is likely that the answer is also an integer. This leaves us with $9$ or $17$ . Because both $A$ and $C$ are greater than $9$ and closer to $E$ than $B$ , we can assume that the height increases as the point gets closer to $E$ . Thus, we know the answer is greater than $9$ . The only choice that satisfies both these criteria is $\boxed{17}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid ways to plant four different crops in a 2x2 grid such that the restrictions are satisfied. Specifically, corn and wheat should not be adjacent, and soybeans and potatoes should not be adjacent.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   We have four sections in the grid, which we can label as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

2. **List Possible Combinations:**
   Each section can be planted with one of four crops: corn (C), wheat (W), soybeans (S), or potatoes (P). Therefore, there are \(4^4 = 256\) possible combinations without any restrictions.

3. **Apply Restrictions:**
   We need to eliminate the invalid combinations based on the adjacency restrictions:
   - Adjacency of corn and wheat (C and W)
   - Adjacency of soybeans and potatoes (S and P)

4. **Count Valid Combinations:**
   We will use a brute-force approach to check each combination to see if it satisfies the restrictions.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to help with the enumeration and checking of combinations.

import itertools","We will do casework on the type of crops in the field.
Case 1: all of a kind.
If all four sections have the same type of crop, there are simply $\underline{4}$ ways to choose crops for the sections.
Case 2: $\boldsymbol{3}$ of a kind, $\boldsymbol{1}$ of another kind.
Since the one of another kind must be adjacent to two of the other crops, when choosing the type of crops in this case, we cannot choose soybeans and potatoes, or corn and wheat. Therefore, there are $4 \cdot 3 - 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ choices for the two crops we choose for the section (notice we did not choose by $2$ , since the crop we pick first will be the unique one), and $4$ ways to choose which section the unique crop is planted on. This gives us a total of $4 \cdot 8 = \underline{32}$ ways to choose crops for the sections.
Case 3: $\boldsymbol{2}$ of a kind, $\boldsymbol{2}$ of another kind.
We cannot choose corn and wheat, or soybeans and potatoes, once again, because if we do, the two would have to be adjacent in some way, which the problem disallows. So, there are ${4 \choose 2} - 2 = 4$ ways to choose our two crops (notice that we did choose by $2$ , since there are two of both crops). There are ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose where one of the crops go, so there are $4 \cdot 6 = \underline{24}$ ways to choose crops for the sections.
Case 4: $\boldsymbol{2}$ of a kind, $\boldsymbol{1}$ of another kind, $\boldsymbol{1}$ of another kind.
In cases 2 and 3, we excluded the possibility of choosing bad pairs for our crops (i.e. soybeans and potatoes, or corn and wheat). In this case, it is inevitable that we choose a bad pair, because we are choosing $3$ crops this time. The two sections of the same kind must contain the crop that is not part of the bad pair in the trio: for example, if we choose corn, soybeans and potatoes as our three crop types, nor soybeans and potatoes can be the type which occupies two sections in this case; corn must be the one to do so. There are $4$ ways to choose the crop that is not part of the bad pair, and then $1$ way to choose the bad pair, giving us $4 \cdot 1 = 4$ ways to choose the crops. To separate the bad pair of crops, the two of a kind must be diagonally placed. There are $2$ ways to choose where the two of a kind go, and $2$ ways to choose which of the bad pair goes where, giving us $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ ways to choose the positions for the crops. In total, there are $4 \cdot 4 = \underline{16}$ ways to choose crops for the sections.
Case 5: every single crop.
Bad pairs must be on the same diagonal, so there are $2$ ways to choose which pair gets which diagonal, and $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ ways to choose which of each pair goes where on the diagonal, giving us $2 \cdot 4 = \underline{8}$ ways to choose crops for the sections.
Adding up all our values, we get our final answer of $4+32+24+16+8 = \boxed{84}$"

We use I, II, III, IV to denote four quadrants, respectively.
We determine an arrangement in the following steps.
Step 1: Determine the crop planted in I.
The number of ways is $4$
Step 2: Determine the crops planed in II, III, IV.
To find the number of arrangements in this step, without loss of generality, we assume that we plant C in I.
We do the following casework analysis.
Case 1: Both II and IV are planted with C.
In this case, the number of ways to plant in III is $3$
Case 2: In II and IV, only one quadrant is planted with C, and another quadrant is planted with either S or P.
In this case, we determine an arrangement in the following steps.
Step 2.1: Determine whether C is planted in II or IV.
The number of ways is $2$
Step 2.2: In II or IV not planted with C, determine whether it is planted with S or P.
The number of ways is $2$
Step 2.3: Determine the crop planted in III.
The number of ways is $2$
Following from the rule of product, the number of ways in this case is $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$
Case 3: II and IV are both planted with S or W.
In this case, we determine an arrangement in the following steps.
Step 2.1: Determine whether S or W is planted in II and IV.
The number of ways is $2$
Step 2.2: Determine the crop planted in III.
The number of ways is $3$
Following from the rule of product, the number of ways in this case is $2 \cdot 3 = 6$
Case 4: In II and IV, exactly one quadrant is planted with S and another one is planted with W.
Step 2.1: Determine which quadrant in II and IV is planted with S.
The number of ways is $2$
Step 2.2: Determine the crop planted in III.
The number of ways is $2$
Following from the rule of product, the number of ways in this case is $2 \cdot 2 = 4$
Putting all cases together, the total number of arrangements in Step 2 is $3 + 8 + 6 + 4 = 21$
Following from the rule of product, the total number of arrangements is $4 \cdot 21 = 84$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{84}$"

   We have four sections in the grid, which we can label as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

2. **List Possible Combinations:**
   Each section can be planted with one of four crops: corn (C), wheat (W), soybeans (S), or potatoes (P). Therefore, there are \(4^4 = 256\) possible combinations without any restrictions.

3. **Apply Restrictions:**
   We need to eliminate the invalid combinations based on the adjacency restrictions:
   - Adjacency of corn and wheat (C and W)
   - Adjacency of soybeans and potatoes (S and P)

4. **Count Valid Combinations:**
   We will use a brute-force approach to check each combination to see if it satisfies the restrictions.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to help with the enumeration and checking of combinations.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry of the situation.

1. **Inner Disk Rolling Around a Square:**
   - The inner disk of radius \(1\) rolls around the inside of a square with side length \(s - 2 \times 1 = s - 2\).
   - The area swept by the disk as it rolls around one side of the square is a sector of a circle with radius \(1\) and angle \(90^\circ\) (since it's a quarter circle).
   - The area of one such quarter circle is \(\frac{1}{4}\pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).
   - Since the square has 4 sides, the total area swept by the inner disk is \(4 \times \frac{\pi}{4} = \pi (s-2)^2\).

2. **Outer Disk Rolling Around a Square:**
   - The outer disk of radius \(1\) rolls around the outside of the square with side length \(s\).
   - Similarly, the area swept by the outer disk is also \(4 \times \frac{\pi}{4} = \pi s^2\).

3. **Given Relationship:**
   - We are given that the area swept by the outer disk is twice the area swept by the inner disk:
     \[
     \pi s^2 = 2 \pi (s-2)^2
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     s^2 = 2 (","The side length of the inner square traced out by the disk with radius $1$ is $s-4.$ However, there is a piece at each corner (bounded by two line segments and one $90^\circ$ arc) where the disk never sweeps out. The combined area of these four pieces is $(1+1)^2-\pi\cdot1^2=4-\pi.$ As a result, we have \[A=s^2-(s-4)^2-(4-\pi)=8s-20+\pi.\] Now, we consider the second disk. The part it sweeps is comprised of four quarter circles with radius $2$ and four rectangles with side lengths of $2$ and $s.$ When we add it all together, we have $2A=8s+4\pi,$ or \[A=4s+2\pi.\] We equate the expressions for $A,$ and then solve for $s:$ \[8s-20+\pi=4s+2\pi.\] We get $s=5+\frac{\pi}{4},$ so the answer is $5+1+4=\boxed{10}.$"

### Solution: To determine the number of ordered pairs \((b, c)\) of positive integers such that neither of the quadratic equations \(x^2 + bx + c = 0\) nor \(x^2 + cx + b = 0\) has two distinct real solutions, we need to analyze the discriminants of both quadratics.

For the quadratic equation \(x^2 + bx + c = 0\) to not have two distinct real solutions, its discriminant must be non-positive:
\[
b^2 - 4c \leq 0
\]

Similarly, for the quadratic equation \(x^2 + cx + b = 0\) to not have two distinct real solutions, its discriminant must also be non-positive:
\[
c^2 - 4b \leq 0

We need to find the number of positive integer pairs \((b, c)\) such that both inequalities are satisfied simultaneously.

Let's solve this using Python and SymPy:

1. Define the inequalities \(b^2 \leq 4c\) and \(c^2 \leq 4b\).
2. Iterate over possible values of \(b\) and \(c\) to find pairs that satisfy both inequalities.

inequality2 = c**2 <= 4*b

# Initialize a set to store the valid pairs

3. **Define the recursive function \( f_j(n) \):**
   For \( j \geq 2 \), \( f_j(n) = f_1(f_{j-1}(n)) \).

4. **Iterate to find \( f_{50}(n) \):**
   We need to compute \( f_{50}(n) \) for each \( n \leq 50 \) and check if it equals 12.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to handle prime factorization and divisor calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Function to calculate f_1(n","First, we can test values that would make $f(x)=12$ true. For this to happen $x$ must have $6$ divisors, which means its prime factorization is in the form $pq^2$ or $p^5$ , where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. Listing out values less than $50$ which have these prime factorizations, we find $12,18,20,28,44,45,50$ for $pq^2$ , and just $32$ for $p^5$ . Here $12$ especially catches our eyes, as this means if one of $f_i(n)=12$ , each of $f_{i+1}(n), f_{i+2}(n), ...$ will all be $12$ . This is because $f_{i+1}(n)=f(f_i(n))$ (as given in the problem statement), so were $f_i(n)=12$ , plugging this in we get $f_{i+1}(n)=f(12)=12$ , and thus the pattern repeats. Hence, as long as for a $i$ , such that $i\leq 50$ and $f_{i}(n)=12$ $f_{50}(n)=12$ must be true, which also immediately makes all our previously listed numbers, where $f(x)=12$ , possible values of $n$
We also know that if $f(x)$ were to be any of these numbers, $x$ would satisfy $f_{50}(n)$ as well. Looking through each of the possibilities aside from $12$ , we see that $f(x)$ could only possibly be equal to $20$ and $18$ , and still have $x$ less than or equal to $50$ . This would mean $x$ must have $10$ , or $9$ divisors, and testing out, we see that $x$ will then be of the form $p^4q$ , or $p^2q^2$ . The only two values less than or equal to $50$ would be $48$ and $36$ respectively. From here there are no more possible values, so tallying our possibilities we count $\boxed{10}$ values (Namely $12,18,20,28,32,36,44,45,48,50$ )."

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to handle prime factorization and divisor calculations.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Function to calculate f_1(n","First, take note that the maximum possible value of $f_1(n)$ for $1 \le n \le k$ increases as $k$ increases (it is a step function), i.e. it is increasing. Likewise, as $k$ decreases, the maximum possible value of $f_1(n)$ decreases as well. Also, let $f_1(n) = 2d(n)$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of n.
Since $n \le 50$ $f_1(n) <= 20$ . This maximum occurs when $d(n) = 10 \implies n = 2^4 \cdot 3 = 48$ . Next, since $f_1(n) <=20$ $f_1(f_1(n)) \le 12 \implies f_2(n) \le 12$ . This maximum occurs when $d(f_1(n)) = 6 \implies n = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18, n = 2^2 \cdot 3 = 12$ . Since $f_2(n) \le 12$ $f_1(f_2(n)) \le 12 \implies f_3(n) \le 12$ , once again. This maximum again occurs when $d(f_2(n)) = 6 \implies f_2(n) = 2^2 \cdot 3 = 12$ . Now, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $f_2(n) < 12$ . Then, $f_3(n) < 12$ (since $f_2(n) = 12$ was the only number that would maximize $f_3(n))$ for $f_2(n) \le 12$ ). As a result, since $f_1(n)$ is increasing, and because $12$ is where $f_1$ steps down from a maximum of $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ , we must have that $f_1(f_3(n)) < f_1(12) = 12 \implies f_4(n) < 12$ . We continue applying $f_1$ on both sides (which is possible since $f_1$ is increasing) until we reach $f_50$ , giving us that $f_50(n) < 12$ . However, $f_50(n) = 12$ , which is a contradiction. Thus, $f_2(n) = 12$
Now, let us finally solve for the solutions. $f_2(n) = 12 \implies f_1(f_1(n)) = 12 \implies d(f_1(n)) = 6$ $d(f_1(n)) = 6 \implies f_1(n) = p^2 \cdot q$ where $p$ and $q$ are primes. Since $f_1(n) \le 20$ $f_1(n)$ can only be $12$ $18$ , or $20$ . If $f_1(n) = 12$ , then $d(n) = 6 \implies n = p^5, p^2 \cdot q \implies n \in \{ 12, 18, 20, 28, 32, 44, 45, 50 \}$ , resulting in 8 solutions. If $f_1(n) = 18$ , then $d(n) = 9 \implies n = p^8, p^2 \cdot q^2 \implies n = 36$ , giving us one more solution. Finally, $f_1(n) = 20 \implies d(n) = 10 \implies n = p^9, p^4 \cdot q \implies n = 48$ . Thus, in total, we have $\boxed{10}$ solutions."

We have $f_1 \left( n \right) = 16$ $f_2 \left( n \right) = f_1 \left( 16 \right) = 10$ $f_3 \left( n \right) = f_2 \left( 10 \right) = 8$ . Hence, Observation 2 implies $f_{50} \left( n \right) = 8$

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ways we can label each of the 12 edges of a cube with either 0 or 1 such that the sum of the labels on the edges of each of the 6 faces of the cube equals 2.

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Cube Structure**: A cube has 12 edges and 6 faces. Each face is a square.
2. **Labeling Constraint**: Each edge can be labeled 0 or 1.
3. **Sum Constraint**: The sum of the labels on the edges of each face must be equal to 2.

To proceed, we can use Python and SymPy to enumerate all possible labelings and check which ones satisfy the given constraints.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Define the cube structure**: Represent the cube and identify the faces.
2. **Generate all possible labelings**: There are \(2^{12}\) possible labelings since each of the 12 edges can be either 0 or 1.
3. **Check each labeling**: For each labeling, calculate the sum of the labels on each face and check if it equals 2.
4. **Count valid labelings**: Count the number of labelings that satisfy the condition.

    [2,","Since we want the sum of the edges of each face to be $2$ , we need there to be two $1$ s and two $0$ s on each face. Through experimentation, we find that either $2, 4,$ or all of them have $1$ s adjacent to $1$ s and $0$ s adjacent to $0$ on each face. WLOG, let the first face (counterclockwise) be $0,0,1,1$ . In this case we are trying to have all of them be adjacent to each other. First face: $0,0,1,1$ . Second face: $2$ choices: $1,0,0,1$ or $0,0,1,1$ . After that, it is basically forced and everything will fall in to place. Since we assumed WLOG, we need to multiply $2$ by $4$ to get a total of $8$ different arrangements.
Secondly, $4$ of the faces have all of them adjacent and $2$ of the faces do not: WLOG counting counterclockwise, we have $0,0,1,1$ . Then, we choose the other face next to it. There are two cases, which are $0,1,0,1$ and $1,0,1,0$ . Therefore, this subcase has $4$ different arrangements. Then, we can choose the face at front to be $1,0,1,0$ . This has $4$ cases.

1. Let \( M \) be the temperature in Minneapolis at noon.
2. Let \( S \) be the temperature in St. Louis at noon.

From the problem statement, we have:
\[ M = S + N \]

At 4:00 PM:
\[ M_{4:00} = M - 5 = S + N - 5 \]
\[ S_{4:00} = S + 3 \]

The difference in temperatures at 4:00 PM is given as:
\[ |M_{4:00} - S_{4:00}| = 2 \]

Substituting the expressions for \( M_{4:00} \) and \( S_{4:00} \):
\[ |(S + N - 5) - (S + 3)| = 2 \]

Simplify the absolute value equation:
\[ |S + N - 5 - S - 3| = 2 \]
\[ |N - 8| = 2 \]

This gives us two equations to solve for \( N \):
\[ N - 8 = 2 \]
\[ N - 8 = -2 \]

Solving these equations:
\[ N = 10 \]
\[ N = 6 \]

Thus, the possible values of \( N \) are 10 and 6. The product of these values is:
\[ 10 \times 6 = 60 \]

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to systematically explore all pairs of positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a + b = 15\). For each pair, we will compute the fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) and consider all possible sums of these fractions. We will then determine the number of distinct integers that can be formed from these sums.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Generate all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = 15\).
2. Compute the special fractions \(\frac{a}{b}\) and \(\frac{b}{a}\) (in case the fraction is not in simplest form).
3. Compute all possible sums of these fractions.
4. Identify and count the distinct integer results from the sums.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to handle the fractions and ensure accuracy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the sum constraint
total_sum = 15

# Generate all pairs (a, b) such that a + b = 15
pairs = [(a, total_sum - a) for a in range(1, total_sum)]

# Set to store distinct sums of special fractions
distinct_integers = set()

# Compute and sum special fractions
for a, b in pairs:
    fraction1 = sp.Rational(a, b)
    fraction2 = sp.Rational(b, a)
    
    # Add the fractions and their integer parts to the set
    distinct_integers.add(int(fraction1 + fraction2))

# The number of distinct integers
num_distinct_integers = len(distinct_integers)
print(num_distinct_integers)

The","The special fractions are \[\frac{1}{14},\frac{2}{13},\frac{3}{12},\frac{4}{11},\frac{5}{10},\frac{6}{9},\frac{7}{8},\frac{8}{7},\frac{9}{6},\frac{10}{5},\frac{11}{4},\frac{12}{3},\frac{13}{2},\frac{14}{1}.\] We rewrite them in the simplest form: \[\frac{1}{14},\frac{2}{13},\frac{1}{4},\frac{4}{11},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\frac{7}{8},1\frac{1}{7},1\frac{1}{2},2,2\frac{3}{4},4,6\frac{1}{2},14.\] Note that two unlike fractions in the simplest form cannot sum to an integer. So, we only consider the fractions whose denominators appear more than once: \[\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},1\frac{1}{2},2,2\frac{3}{4},4,6\frac{1}{2},14.\] For the set $\{2,4,14\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $4,6,8,16,18,28.$
For the set $\left\{\frac{1}{2},1\frac{1}{2},6\frac{1}{2}\right\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $1,2,3,7,8,13.$
For the set $\left\{\frac{1}{4},2\frac{3}{4}\right\},$ two elements (not necessarily different) can sum to $3.$
Together, there are $\boxed{11}$ distinct integers that can be written as the sum of two, not necessarily different, special fractions: \[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,13,16,18,28.\] ~KingRavi ~samrocksnature ~Wilhelm Z ~MRENTHUSIASM ~Steven Chen (www.professorchenedu.com)"

Case 2: fraction + fraction
The fractions we have are $\frac{5}{10}$ (or $\frac{1}{2}$ ), $\frac{9}{6}$ (or $\frac{3}{2}$ ), and $\frac{13}{2}$ . Similarly, there are $\dbinom{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose different-numbered pairs and $3$ ways to choose the same-numbered pairs. So, $3+3=6$

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest prime divisor of \(16383\). Once we have that prime number, we can then compute the sum of its digits.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Find the prime factors of \(16383\)**:
   - We will iterate through potential prime factors and check if they are divisors of \(16383\).

2. **Identify the greatest prime factor**:
   - From the list of prime factors, we will determine the largest one.

3. **Compute the sum of the digits of the greatest prime factor**:
   - Once we have the greatest prime factor, we will sum its digits.

Let's implement this in Python using the `sympy` library to help with prime factorization and checking for prime numbers.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the number
number = 16383

# Find the prime factors of the number
prime_factors = list(sp.primefactors(number))

# Get the greatest prime factor
greatest_prime_factor = max(prime_factors)

# Compute the sum of the digits of the greatest prime factor
sum_of_digits = sum(map(int, str(greatest_prime_factor)))

# Print the result
print(sum_of_digits)
```
```output
7

The sum of the digits of the greatest prime number that is a divisor of \(16383\) is \(\boxed{7}\).

Since $129$ is composite, $127$ is the largest prime which can divide $16383$ . The sum of $127$ 's digits is $1+2+7=\boxed{10}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the square \(ABCD\) given the conditions about the points \(P\) and \(Q\) and the segments \(BP\) and \(CQ\) intersecting at right angles at \(R\) with \(BR = 6\) and \(PR = 7\).

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define Coordinates:**
   - Let the side length of the square \(ABCD\) be \(s\).
   - Place \(A\) at the origin: \(A = (0, 0)\).
   - Then \(B = (s, 0)\), \(C = (s, s)\), and \(D = (0, s)\","As above, note that $\bigtriangleup BPA \cong \bigtriangleup CQB$ , which means that $QC =  13$ . In addition, note that $BR$ is the altitude of a right triangle to its hypotenuse, so $\bigtriangleup BQR \sim \bigtriangleup CBR \sim \bigtriangleup CQB$ . Let the side length of the square be $x$ ; using similarity side ratios of $\bigtriangleup BQR$ to $\bigtriangleup CQB$ , we get \[\frac{6}{x} = \frac{QB}{13} \implies QB \cdot x =  78\] Note that $QB^2 + x^2 = 13^2 = 169$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we can use the expansion $(a+b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2$ to produce two equations and two variables;
\[(QB + x)^2 = QB^2 + 2QB\cdot x + x^2 \implies (QB+x)^2 = 169 + 2 \cdot 78 \implies QB+x = \sqrt{13(13)+13(12)} = \sqrt{13 \cdot 25} = 5\sqrt{13}\] \[(QB-x)^2 = QB^2 - 2QB\cdot x + x^2 \implies (QB - x)^2 = 169 - 2\cdot 78 \implies \pm(QB-x) = \sqrt{13(13) - 13(12)}\]
Since $QB-x$ is negative, it doesn't make sense in the context of this problem, so we go with \[x-QB = \sqrt{13(13) - 13(12)} = \sqrt{13 \cdot 1} = \sqrt{13}\]
We want $x^2$ , so we want to find $x$ . Adding the first equation to the second, we get \[2x = 6\sqrt{13} \implies x = 3\sqrt{13}\]
Then $x^2$ $(3\sqrt{13}^2) = 9 \cdot 13 = 117 = \boxed{117}$"

Now, let the side length of the square be $s.$ Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, $CR = \sqrt{x^2-36}.$ Plugging all of this information in, we get \[\frac{s}{\sqrt{s^2-36}} = \frac{13}{s}.\] Simplifying gives \[s^2=13\sqrt{s^2-36},\] Squaring both sides gives \[s^4 = 169s^2- 169\cdot 36 \implies s^4-169s^2 + 169\cdot 36 = 0.\] We now set $s^2=t,$ and get the equation $t^2-169t + 169\cdot 36 = 0.$ From here, notice we want to solve for $t$ , as it is precisely $s^2,$ or the area of the square. So we use the Quadratic formula , and though it may seem bashy, we hope for a nice cancellation of terms. \[t = \frac{169\pm\sqrt{169^2-4\cdot 36 \cdot 169}}{2}.\] It seems scary, but factoring $169$ from the square root gives us \[t = \frac{169\pm \sqrt{169 \cdot (169-144)}}{2} = \frac{169 \pm \sqrt{169 \cdot 25}}{2} = \frac{169 \pm 13\cdot 5}{2} = \frac{169\pm 65}{2},\] giving us the solutions \[t=52, 117.\] We instantly see that $t=52$ is way too small to be an area of this square ( $52$ isn't even an answer choice, so you can skip this step if out of time) because then the side length would be $2\sqrt{13}$ and then, even the largest line you can draw inside the square (the diagonal)  is $2\sqrt{26},$ which is less than $13$ (line $PB$ ) And thus, $t$ must be $117$ , and our answer is $\boxed{117}.$ $\blacksquare$"

1. **Define Coordinates:**
   - Let the side length of the square \(ABCD\) be \(s\).
   - Place \(A\) at the origin: \(A = (0, 0)\).
   - Then \(B = (s, 0)\), \(C = (s, s)\), and \(D = (0, s)\","Denote $a = RC$ . Now tilt your head to the right and view $R, \overrightarrow{RB}$ and $\overrightarrow{RC}$ as the origin, $x$ -axis and $y$ -axis, respectively. In particular, we have points $B(6,0), C(0,a), P(-7,0)$ . Note that side length of the square $ABCD$ is $BC = \sqrt{a^2 + 36}$ . Also equation of line $BC$ is \[\underbrace{\frac{x}{6} + \frac{y}{a} = 1}_{\text{intercepts form}}     \quad \implies \quad     ax + 6y - 6a = 0.\] Because the distance from $P(-7,0)$ to line $\color[rgb]{0,0.4,0.65}BC: ax + 6y - 6a = 0$ is also the side length $\sqrt{a^2 + 36}$ , we can apply the point-line distance formula to get \[\frac{|a\cdot(-7) + 6 \cdot 0 - 6a|}{\sqrt{a^2 + 36}} = {\sqrt{a^2 + 36}}\] which reduces to $|13a| = a^2 + 36$ . Since $a$ is positive, the last equations factors as $a^2 - 13a + 36 = (a-4)(a-9) = 0$ . Now judging from the figure, we learn that $a > RB = 6$ . So $a = 9$ .
Therefore, the area of the square $ABCD$ is $BC^2 = RC^2 + RB^2 = a^2 + 6^2 = \boxed{117}$"

Because $\angle QRB = \angle QBC = 90^\circ$ $\angle BCQ = \alpha$
Hence, $AB = BP \cos \angle PBA = 13 \cos \alpha$ $BC = \frac{BR}{\sin \angle BCQ} = \frac{6}{\sin \alpha}$
Because $ABCD$ is a square, $AB = BC$ .
Hence, $13 \cos \alpha = \frac{6}{\sin \alpha}$
Therefore, \begin{align*} \sin 2 \alpha & = 2 \sin \alpha \cos \alpha \\ & = \frac{12}{13} . \end{align*}
Thus, $\cos 2 \alpha = \pm \frac{5}{13}$
$\textbf{Case 1}$ $\cos 2 \alpha = \frac{5}{13}$
Thus, $\cos \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 2 \alpha}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{13}}$
Hence, $AB = 13 \cos \alpha = 3 \sqrt{13}$
Therefore, ${\rm Area} \ ABCD = AB^2 = 117$
$\textbf{Case 2}$ $\cos 2 \alpha = - \frac{5}{13}$
Thus, $\cos \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 2 \alpha}{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}}$
Hence, $AB = 13 \cos \alpha = 2 \sqrt{13}$
However, we observe $BQ = \frac{BR}{\cos \alpha} = 3 \sqrt{13} > AB$ .
Therefore, in this case, point $Q$ is not on the segment $AB$
Therefore, this case is infeasible.

   - Chris and Silva each choose two adjacent balls at random and interchange them.
   - We need to find the expected number of balls that return to their original positions after these two transpositions.

2. **Mathematical Representation:**
   - Represent the positions of the balls as a permutation of the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
   - Each transposition can be represented as a swap of two adjacent elements in the permutation.
   - We need to calculate the expected number of fixed points (balls that remain in their original positions) after two such swaps.

   - The expected number of fixed points in a permutation of \(n\) elements after \(k\) transpositions can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \mathbb{E}(\text{fixed points}) = n - 2k \cdot \frac{(n-1)!}{n^{2k-2}}
     \]

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the resulting polygon formed by the overlapping of three rotated squares. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - We have three squares with side length 6.
   - The middle sheet is rotated by \(30^\circ\).
   - The top sheet is rotated by \(60^\circ\).

2. **Calculate the Area of the Polygon:**
   - We need to find the area of the polygon formed by the intersection of these squares.
   - The area can be expressed in the form \(a - b\sqrt{c}\).

3. **Use SymPy to Calculate the Area:**
   - We will use SymPy to calculate the exact area of the polygon.

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the side length of the squares
side_length = 6

# Define the angles of rotation
theta1 = sp.rad(30)  # 30 degrees in radians
theta2 = sp.rad(60)  # 60 degrees in radians

# Calculate the area of the polygon using the Shoelace formula
def polygon_area(vertices):
    x, y = zip(*vertices)
    x = sp.Matrix(x + (x","First note the useful fact that if $R$ is the circumradius of a dodecagon ( $12$ -gon) the area of the figure is $3R^2.$ If we connect the vertices of the $3$ squares we get a dodecagon. The radius of circumcircle of the dodecagon is simply half the diagonal of the square, which is $3\sqrt{2}.$ Thus the area of the dodecagon is $3 \cdot (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3 \cdot 18 = 54.$ But, the problem asked for the area of the combined figure which was made from the rotated squares. This area is the area of the dodecagon, which was found, subtracting the $12$ isosceles triangles, which are formed when connecting the vertices of the squares to created the dodecagon. To find this area, we need to know the base of the isosceles triangle, call this $x.$ Then, we can use the Law of Cosines on the triangle that is formed from the two vertices of the square and the center of the square. After computing, we get that $x = 3\sqrt{3} -3.$ Realize that the $12$ isosceles are congruent with an angle measure of $120^{\circ},$ this means that we can create $4$ congruent equilateral triangles with side length of $3\sqrt3 - 3.$ The area of the equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (3\sqrt{3} -3)^2 =  \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \cdot (36 - 18\sqrt{3}) = \frac{36\sqrt{3} - 54}{4}.$ Thus, the area of all the twelve small equilateral traingles are $4 \cdot \frac{36\sqrt{3} - 54}{4} = 36\sqrt{3} - 54$ . Thus, the requested area is $54 - (36\sqrt{3} - 54) = 108 - 36\sqrt{3}.$ Thus, $a+b+c = 108 + 36 + 3 = 147,$ so the answer is $\boxed{147}.$"

    x = sp.Matrix(x + (x","To make things simpler, let's take only the original sheet and the 30 degree rotated sheet. Then the diagram is this;
[asy]  size(10cm,0); path p = box((0,0), (1,1)); draw(p, black + linewidth(2.0pt)); draw(rotate(30,(1/2,1/2))*p,black + linewidth(2.0pt)); /*Rotate 60 degrees*/  [/asy]
The area of this diagram is the original square plus the area of the four triangles that 'jut' out of the square. Because the square is rotated $30^{\circ}$ , each triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle. Similarly, the triangles that are bounded on the inside of the original square outside of the rotated square are also congruent 30-60-90 triangles. Noting this, we can do some labelling:
[asy]  size(10cm,0); path p = box((0,0), (1,1)); draw(p, black + linewidth(2.0pt)); draw(rotate(30,(1/2,1/2))*p,black + linewidth(2.0pt)); /*Rotate 60 degrees*/ label(""$y$"",(0.1,-0.05)); label(""$x$"",(0.4,0.05)); label(""$y\sqrt{3}$"",(0.8,-0.05)); label(""$\frac{x}{2}$"",(0.22,-0.12)); label(""$\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2}$"",(0.5,-0.15)); label(""$2y$"",(0.8,0.15)); label(""$y$"",(1.05,0.1)); label(""$\frac{x}{2}$"",(1.12,0.22));  [/asy]
Since the side lengths of the squares must be the same, and they are both 6, we have a system of equations; \[y+x+y\sqrt{3} = 6\] \[\frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2y + \frac{x}{2} = 6\]
We solve this to get $x = 6-2\sqrt{3}$ and $y = 3-\sqrt{3}$
The area of each triangle is $\frac{x}{2} \cdot \frac{x\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}  = 6\sqrt{3} - 9$ by plugging in $x$
The rotated 60 degree square is the same thing as rotating it 30 degrees counterclockwise, so it's triangles that jut out of the square will be congruent to the triangles we have found, and therefore they will have the same area.
Unfortunately, when drawing all three squares, we see the two triangles overlap; take the very top for example.
[asy] import olympiad; size(10cm); pair A,B,C,D,E,F,G; A = (0.211,0); B=(0.3657,0); C = (0.63397,0); D = (0.789,0); E = (0.31666,0.1823); F=(0.5,0.077); G=(0.68334,0.1823); draw((0,0)--(1,0),black+linewidth(2pt)); draw(A--E--C--cycle); draw(B--D--G--cycle); label(""$A$"",A,S); label(""$B$"",B,S); label(""$C$"",C,S); label(""$D$"",D,S); label(""$E$"",E,N); label(""$F$"",F,N); label(""$G$"",G,N); [/asy]
The area of this shape is twice the area of each of the triangles that we have already found minus the area of the small triangle that is overlapped by the two by PIE. Now we only need to find the area of $\bigtriangleup BCF$
$\angle GBD \cong \angle ECA \cong 30^{\circ}$ and by symmetry $\bigtriangleup BCF$ is isosceles, so it is a 30-30-120 triangle. If we draw a perpendicular, we split it into two 30-60-90 triangles;
[asy] import olympiad; size(10cm); pair A,B,C,D,E,F,G; A = (0.211,0); B=(0.3657,0); C = (0.63397,0); D = (0.789,0); E = (0.31666,0.1823); F=(0.5,0.077); G=(0.68334,0.1823); draw((0,0)--(1,0),black+linewidth(2pt)); draw(A--E--C--cycle); draw(B--D--G--cycle); draw(F--(0.5,0)); label(""$A$"",A,S); label(""$B$"",B,S); label(""$C$"",C,S); label(""$D$"",D,S); label(""$E$"",E,N); label(""$F$"",F,N); label(""$G$"",G,N); label(""$H$"",(0.5,0),S); [/asy]
By symmetry, the distance from A to the edge of the square is equal to the distance from D to the edge of the square is equal to $y$ . AC = BD = $x$ , and the side length of the square is 6, so we use PIE to obtain \[x+x-BC = 6-y-y \implies BC = 12 - 6\sqrt{3}\] To find the height of $\bigtriangleup BFC$ , we see that $HC = \frac{BC}{2} = 6-3\sqrt{3}$ . Then by 30-60-90 triangles, $HF = \frac{HC}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3} - 3$ . Finally, the area of $\bigtriangleup BFC = \frac{BC \cdot HF}{2} = 21\sqrt{3}-36$
Putting it all together, the area of the entire diagram is the area of the square plus four of these triangle-triangle intersections. The area of these intersections by PIE is $2 \cdot [ACE] - [BFC] = 12\sqrt{3}-18-(21\sqrt{3}-36) = 18-9\sqrt{3}$ . 
Therefore the total area is $36 + 4 \cdot(18-9\sqrt{3}) = 36 + 72 - 36 \sqrt{3} = 108 - 36\sqrt{3}$
Thus $a + b + c = 108+36+3 = 147 = \boxed{147}$"

Denote by $O$ the center of this dodecagon.
Hence, $\angle AOB = \frac{360^\circ}{12} = 30^\circ$
Because the length of a side of a square is 6, $AO = 3 \sqrt{2}$
Hence, $AB = 2 AO \sin \frac{\angle AOB}{2} = 3 \left( \sqrt{3} - 1 \right)$
We notice that $\angle MAB = \angle MBA = 30^\circ$ .
Hence, $AM = \frac{AB}{2\cos \angle MAB} = 3 - \sqrt{3}$
Therefore, the area of the region that three squares cover is \begin{align*} &  \ [ABCDEFGHIJKL] - 12[MAB] \\ & = 12 [OAB] - 12 [MAB] \\ & = 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} OA \cdot OB \sin \angle AOB - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} MA \cdot MB \sin \angle AMB \\ & = 6 OA^2 \sin \angle AOB - 6 MA^2 \sin \angle AMB \\ & = 108 - 36\sqrt{3} \end{align*}

Note that because there are three $90^{\circ}$ squares separated by $\frac{90^{\circ}}{3} = 30^{\circ}$ , each side of the 24-sided polygon is equal in length, meaning to calculate the area of the whole polygon, we find the area of $\bigtriangleup OAC$ and multiply by 24.
To find $[\bigtriangleup OAC]$ , we already know the height $\overline{OM}$ is the sidelength of the square over $2$ , or $\frac{6}{2}=3$ , so we just need the length of the base $\overline{AC}$ . Notice that $\bigtriangleup OCM$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle since $\angle COM = \frac{360^{\circ}}{12} = 30^{\circ}$ , so $\overline{CM} = \frac{\overline{OM}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3}$ . Then $\overline{AC} = \overline{AM} - \overline{CM} = \frac{6}{2} - \sqrt{3} = 3 - \sqrt{3}$ , so \begin{align*} & [\bigtriangleup AOC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \overline{OM} \cdot \overline{AC} \\ & = \frac{1}{2} (3)(3 - \sqrt{3}) \\ & = \frac{9 - 3\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{align*}
Then the whole area of the polygon is $\frac{9 - 3\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 24 = 108 - 36\sqrt{3}$ . The desired solution is then $108 + 36 + 3 = 147$ , so the answer is $\boxed{147}$"

When approximating values, as we will shortly do, the minus one will become negligible so we can ignore it.
When we take the power of ten out of the square root, we’ll be multiplying by another power of ten, so the leading digit will not change. Thus the leading digit of $f(r)$ will be equal to the leading digit of $\sqrt[r]{\frac{7}{9} \cdot 10^{313(\mod r)}}$
Then $f(2)$ is the first digit of $\sqrt{\frac{7}{9}\cdot(10)} = \sqrt{\frac{70}{9}} = \sqrt{7.\ldots} \approx 2$
$f(3) - \sqrt[3]{\frac{7}{9} \cdot 10} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{70}{9}} = \sqrt[3]{7.\ldots} \approx 1$
$f(4) - \sqrt[4]{\frac{7}{9} \cdot 10} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{70}{9}} = \sqrt[4]{7.\ldots} \approx 1$
$f(5) - \sqrt[5]{\frac{7}{9} \cdot 1000} = \sqrt[5]{\frac{7000}{9}} = \sqrt[5]{777.\ldots} \approx 3$
$f(6) - \sqrt[6]{\frac{7}{9} \cdot 10} = \sqrt[6]{\frac{70}{9}} = \sqrt[6]{7.\ldots} \approx 1$

The problem asks for \[B(\sqrt[2]{x}) + B(\sqrt[3]{x}) + B(\sqrt[4]{x}) + B(\sqrt[5]{x}) + B(\sqrt[6]{x}).\]
From our previous observation, we know that \[B(\sqrt[2]{x}) = B(\sqrt[2]{\frac{x}{100}} = B(\sqrt[2]{\frac{x}{10,000}} = B(\sqrt[2]{\frac{x}{1,000,000}} = \ldots .\] Therefore, $B(\sqrt[2]{x}) = B(\sqrt[2]{7.777 \dots})$ . We can evaluate $B(\sqrt[2]{7.777 \dots})$ , the leading digit of $\sqrt[2]{7.777 \dots}$ , to be $2$ . Therefore, $f(2) = 2$
Similarly, we have \[B(\sqrt[3]{x}) = B(\sqrt[3]{\frac{x}{1,000}} = B(\sqrt[3]{\frac{x}{1,000,000}} = B(\sqrt[3]{\frac{x}{1,000,000,000}} = \ldots .\] Therefore, $B(\sqrt[3]{x}) = B(\sqrt[3]{7.777 \ldots})$ . We know $B(\sqrt[3]{7.777 \ldots}) = 1$ , so $f(3) = 1$
Next, \[B(\sqrt[4]{x}) = B(\sqrt[4]{7.777 \ldots})\] and $B(\sqrt[4]{7.777 \ldots}) = 1$ , so $f(4) = 1$
We also have \[B(\sqrt[5]{x}) = B(\sqrt[5]{777.777 \ldots})\] and $B(\sqrt[5]{777.777 \ldots}) = 3$ , so $f(5) = 3$
Finally, \[B(\sqrt[6]{x}) = B(\sqrt[6]{7.777 \ldots})\] and $B(\sqrt[4]{7.777 \ldots}) = 1$ , so $f(6) = 1$
We have that $f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6) = 2+1+1+3+1 = \boxed{8}$"

\[ \lfloor 10^{312/r} \rfloor \]

Because $N > 4 \cdot 10^{312}$ $\sqrt{N} > 2 \cdot 10^{156}$ .
Because $N < 9 \cdot 10^{312}$ $\sqrt{N} < 3 \cdot 10^{156}$
Therefore, $f \left( 2 \right) = 2$
Second, we compute $f \left( 3 \right)$
Because $N > 1 \cdot 10^{312}$ $\sqrt[3]{N} > 1 \cdot 10^{104}$ .
Because $N < 8 \cdot 10^{312}$ $\sqrt[3]{N} < 2 \cdot 10^{104}$

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of intersection points inside the circle where two sides of different regular polygons intersect. Given polygons with 5, 6, 7, and 8 sides are inscribed in the same circle, and no two polygons share a vertex, we need to find the number of intersection points inside the circle where two sides of these polygons intersect.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Understand the Intersection Rule:**
   - For two polygons with \(m\) and \(n\) sides (\(m > n\)), each side of the smaller polygon intersects with the sides of the larger polygon twice (once upon entering and once upon exiting).

2. **Calculate Intersections:**
   - We need to count the intersections between each pair of polygons: (5,6), (5,7), and (5,8) since the polygons are distinct.

3. **Intersection Formula:**
   - For each pair of polygons, the number of intersections is given by \(2 \times m \times n\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the number of sides of the two polygons.

4. **Sum All Intersections:**
   - We will sum the intersections for all pairs to get the total number of intersection points.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure the calculations are accurate.

```python
# Define the number of sides for each polygon
sides = [5, 6, 7, 8]

# Initialize total intersections
total_intersections = 0

# Calculate intersections for each pair of polygons
for i in range(len(sides)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(sides)):
        m = sides[i]
        n = sides[j]
        # Each side of the","Imagine we have $2$ regular polygons with $m$ and $n$ sides and $m>n$ inscribed in a circle without sharing a vertex. We see that each side of the polygon with $n$ sides (the polygon with fewer sides) will be intersected twice.
(We can see this because to have a vertex of the $m$ -gon on an arc subtended by a side of the $n$ -gon, there will be one intersection to “enter” the arc and one to “exit” the arc. ~KingRavi)
This means that we will end up with $2$ times the number of sides in the polygon with fewer sides.
If we have polygons with $5,$ $6,$ $7,$ and $8$ sides, we need to consider each possible pair of polygons and count their intersections.
Throughout $6$ of these pairs, the $5$ -sided polygon has the least number of sides $3$ times, the $6$ -sided polygon has the least number of sides $2$ times, and the $7$ -sided polygon has the least number of sides $1$ time.
Therefore the number of intersections is $2\cdot(3\cdot5+2\cdot6+1\cdot7)=\boxed{68}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the 10 least values of \( n \) such that \( S_n \) is divisible by 3.

First, let's understand the problem:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of all products \( jk \) where \( 1 \leq j < k \leq n \).
- We need to find the sum of the 10 least values of \( n \) such that \( S_n \) is divisible by 3.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:
1. Calculate \( S_n \) for given \( n \).
2. Check if \( S_n \) is divisible by 3.
3. Iterate over values of \( n \) until we find the sum of the 10 values for which \( S_n \) is divisible by 3.

The formula for \( S_n \) is derived from the sum of products of all pairs \( (j, k) \) where \( 1 \leq j < k \leq n \):
\[ S_n = \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq n} jk \]

We can use Python and sympy to calculate \( S_n \) and check its divisibility by 3.

Now, we can look at the different values of $n$ mod $3$ . For $n\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ and $n\equiv 2\pmod{3}$ , then we have $\frac{n(n+1)^2}{2}\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ . However, for $n\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ , we have \[\frac{1\cdot {2}^2}{2}\equiv 2\pmod{3}.\]

","Denote $A_{n, <} = \left\{ \left( j , k \right) : 1 \leq j < k \leq n \right\}$ $A_{n, >} = \left\{ \left( j , k \right) : 1 \leq k < j \leq n \right\}$ and $A_{n, =} = \left\{ \left( j , k \right) : 1 \leq j = k \leq n \right\}$
Hence, $\sum_{\left( j , k \right) \in A_{n,<}} jk = \sum_{\left( j , k \right) \in A_{n,>}} jk = S_n$
Therefore, \begin{align*} S_n & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{\left( j , k \right) \in A_{n,<}} jk = \sum_{\left( j , k \right) \in A_{n,>}} jk \right) \\ & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{1 \leq j, k \leq n} jk - {\left( j , k \right) \in A_{n,=}} jk \right) \\ & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n jk - \sum_{j=1}^n j^2 \right) \\ & = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{n^2 \left( n + 1 \right)^2}{4} - \frac{n \left( n + 1 \right) \left( 2 n + 1 \right) }{6} \right) \\ & = \frac{\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right) \left( 3 n + 2 \right)}{24} . \end{align*}
Hence, $S_n$ is divisible by 3 if and only if $\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right) \left( 3 n + 2 \right)$ is divisible by $24 \cdot 3 = 8 \cdot 9$
First, $\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right) \left( 3 n + 2 \right)$ is always divisible by 8. Otherwise, $S_n$ is not even an integer.
Second, we find conditions for $n$ , such that $\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right) \left( 3 n + 2 \right)$ is divisible by 9.
Because $3 n + 2$ is not divisible by 3, it cannot be divisible by 9.
Hence, we need to find conditions for $n$ , such that $\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right)$ is divisible by 9.
This holds of $n \equiv 0, \pm 1 \pmod{9}$
Therefore, the 10 least values of $n$ such that $\left( n - 1 \right) n \left( n + 1 \right)$ is divisible by 9 (equivalently, $S_n$ is divisible by 3) are 8, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 35.
Their sum is 197.

We use a Planar Graph to represent the larger cube. Each vertex of the planar graph represents a unit cube. Each edge of the planar graph represents a shared face between $2$ neighboring unit cubes. Each face of the planar graph represents a face of the larger cube.
Now the problem becomes a Graph Coloring problem of how many ways to assign $4$ vertices blue and $4$ vertices white with Topological Equivalence . For example, in Figure $(1)$ , as long as the $4$ blue vertices belong to the same planar graph face, the different planar graphs are considered to be topological equivalent by rotating the larger cube.

Here is how the $4$ blue unit cubes are arranged:
In Figure $(1)$ $4$ blue unit cubes are on the same layer (horizontal or vertical).
In Figure $(2)$ $4$ blue unit cubes are in $T$ shape.
In Figure $(3)$ and $(4)$ $4$ blue unit cubes are in $S$ shape.
In Figure $(5)$ $3$ blue unit cubes are in $L$ shape, and the other is isolated without a shared face.
In Figure $(6)$ $2$ pairs of neighboring blue unit cubes are isolated from each other without a shared face.
In Figure $(7)$ $4$ blue unit cubes are isolated from each other without a shared face.

Note that there must be four of each color, so however many number of one color are in the bottom, there will be four minus that number of the color on the top. We do casework on the color distribution of the bottom layer.
Case 1: 4, 0
In this case, there is only one possibility for the top layer - all of the other color - $\binom{4}{4}$ . Therefore there is 1 construction from this case.
Case 2: 3, 1
In this case, the top layer has four possibilities, because there are four different ways to arrange it so that it also has a 3, 1 color distribution - $\binom{4}{3}$ . Therefore there are 4 constructions from this case.
Case 3: 2, 2
In this case, the top layer has six possibilities of arrangement - $\binom{4}{2}$ . However, having adjacent colors one way can be rotated to having adjacent colors any other way, so there is only one construction for the adjacent colors subcase and similarly, only one for the diagonal color subcase. Therefore the total number of constructions for this case is 2.
The total number of constructions for the cube is thus $1+4+2=7=\boxed{7}$"

The fact for Burnside lemma are
1. the sum of stablizer on the same orbit equals to the # of operators;
2. the sum of stablizer can be counted as $fix(g)$
3. the sum of the $fix(g)/|G|$ equals the # of orbit.
Let's start with defining the operator for a cube,
1. $\textbf{e (identity)}$
For identity, there are $\frac{8!}{4!4!} = 70$
2. ${\bf r^{1}, r^{2}, r^{3}}$ to be the rotation axis along three pair of opposite face,
each contains $r^{i}_{90}, r^{i}_{180}, r^{i}_{270}$ where $i= 1, 2, 3$
$fix(r^{i}_{90}) = fix(r^{i}_{270}) = 2\cdot1 = 2$
$fix(r^{i}_{180}) = \frac{4!}{2!\cdot2!} = 6$
therefore $fix(\bf r^{i}) = 2+2+6 = 10$ , and $fix(\bf r^{1})+fix(\bf r^{2})+fix(\bf r^{3}) = 30$
3. ${\bf r^{4}, r^{5}, r^{6}, r^{7}}$ to the rotation axis along four cube diagnals.
each contains $r^{i}_{120}, r^{i}_{240}$ where $i= 4, 5, 6, 7$
$fix(r^{i}_{120}) = fix(r^{i}_{240}) = 2\cdot1\cdot2\cdot1 = 4$
therefore $fix(\bf r^{i}) = 4+4 = 8$ , and $fix(\bf r^{4})+fix(\bf r^{5})+fix(\bf r^{6})+fix(\bf r^{7}) = 32$
4. ${\bf r^{8}, r^{9}, r^{10}, r^{11}, r^{12}, r^{13}}$ to be the rotation axis along 6 pairs of diagnally opposite sides
each contains $r^{i}_{180}$ where $i= 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13$
$fix(r^{i}_{180}) = \frac{4!}{2!\cdot2!} = 6$
therefore $fix(\bf r^{8})+fix(\bf r^{9})+fix(\bf r^{10})+fix(\bf r^{11})+fix(\bf r^{12})+fix(\bf r^{13}) = 36$
5. The total number of operators are
$|G| = 1 + 3\cdot3 + 4\cdot2 + 6\cdot1 = 24$
Based on 1, 2, 3, 4 the total number of stablizer is $70 + 30 + 32 + 36 = 168$

Once we've assigned this cube to be blue, we note that 3 1-by-1-by-1 cubes share a side with it, 3 1-by-1-by-1 cubes share a corner with it, and 1 1-by-1-by-1 cube does not touch the assigned cube at all, from the perspective of someone who can only see the cube's faces. We'll call the first 3 ""adjacent"", the second 3 ""cornering"", and the last one ""opposite.""
We can use a little bit of intuition to confirm that due to the rotation condition, we should treat all adjacents as indistinguishable, all cornerings as indistinguishable, and of course the opposite one is unique from all the others. Thus, we can list out like so (keeping in mind that there are 3 adjacents, 3 cornerings, and 1 opposite, and that we're choosing the positions of the remaining 3 blue cubes):

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to understand the configuration of the shapes inside the larger square","We use Image:2021_AMC_10B_(Nov)_Problem_25,_sol.png to facilitate our analysis.
Denote $\angle AFE = \theta$ . Thus, $\angle FIB = \angle CEF = \angle EKG = \angle KLC = \theta$
Hence, \begin{align*} AB & = AF + FB \\ & = EF \cos \angle EFA + IF \sin \angle FIB \\ & = 3 \cos \theta + \sin \theta , \end{align*} and \begin{align*} AC & = AE + EK + KC \\ & = EF \sin \angle EFA + EG \cos \angle CEG + KG \cos \angle EKG + KL \sin \angle CLK \\ & = 3 \sin \theta + \cos \theta + \cos \theta + \sin \theta \\ & = 2 \cos \theta + 4 \sin \theta . \end{align*}
Because $AB = AC$ $3 \cos \theta + \sin \theta = 2 \cos \theta + 4 \sin \theta$ .
Hence, $\tan \theta = \frac{1}{3}$ .
Hence, $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}$ and $\cos \theta = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}}$
Hence, $AB = AC = BD = CD = \sqrt{10}$
Now, we put the graph to a coordinate plane by setting point $A$ as the origin, putting $AB$ in the $x$ -axis and $AC$ on the $y$ -axis.
Hence, $A = \left( 0 , 0 \right)$ $B = \left( \sqrt{10} , 0 \right)$ $C = \left( 0 , \sqrt{10} \right)$ $D = \left( \sqrt{10} , \sqrt{10} \right)$ $E = \left( 0 , \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$ $F = \left( \frac{9}{\sqrt{10}} , 0 \right)$ $G = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} , \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$ $H = \left( \frac{4}{\sqrt{10}} , \frac{7}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$ $I = \left( \sqrt{10} , \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$
Denote $P = \left( \frac{10 - u}{\sqrt{10}} , \sqrt{10} \right)$ $Q = \left( \sqrt{10} , \frac{10 - v}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$
Because $HPQJ$ is a rectangle, $HP \perp PQ$ . Hence, $m_{HP} m_{PQ} = -1$ .
We have $m_{HP} = \frac{3}{6 - u}$ and $m_{PQ} = - \frac{v}{u}$ .
Hence, \[ \frac{3}{6 - u} \cdot \left( - \frac{v}{u} \right) = - 1 . \hspace{1cm} (1) \]
Because $HPQJ$ is a rectangle, $x_J + x_P = x_H + x_Q$ and $y_J + y_P = y_H + y_Q$ .
Hence, $J = \left( \frac{4 + u}{\sqrt{10}} , \frac{7 - v}{\sqrt{10}} \right)$
The equation of line $GI$ is \begin{align*} y & = \frac{\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} - \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}}}{\sqrt{10} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}}} \left( x - \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \right) + \frac{6}{\sqrt{10}} \\ & = - \frac{x}{3} + \frac{19}{3 \sqrt{10}} . \end{align*} Because point $J$ is on line $GI$ , plugging the coordinates of $J$ into the equation of line $GI$ , we get \[ \frac{7 - v}{\sqrt{10}} = - \frac{\frac{4 + u}{\sqrt{10}}}{3} + \frac{19}{3 \sqrt{10}} . \hspace{1cm} (2) \]
By solving Equations (1) and (2), we get $\left( u , v \right) = \left( 2 , \frac{8}{3} \right)$ or $\left( 3 , 3 \right)$
Case 1: $\left( u , v \right) = \left( 2 , \frac{8}{3} \right)$
We have $P = \left( \frac{8}{\sqrt{10}} , \sqrt{10} \right)$ and $Q = \left( \sqrt{10} , \frac{22}{3 \sqrt{10}} \right)$ .
Thus, $HP = \frac{5}{\sqrt{10}}$ and $PQ = \frac{10}{3\sqrt{10}}$
Therefore, ${\rm Area} \ R = HP \cdot PQ = \frac{5}{3}$
Case 2: $\left( u , v \right) = \left( 3 , 3 \right)$
We have $P = \left( \frac{7}{\sqrt{10}} , \sqrt{10} \right)$ and $Q = \left( \sqrt{10} , \frac{7}{ \sqrt{10}} \right)$ .
Thus, $HP = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{10}}$ and $PQ = \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{10}}$
Therefore, ${\rm Area} \ R = HP \cdot PQ = \frac{9}{5}$
Putting these two cases together, the sum of all possible values of the area of $R$ is $\frac{5}{3} + \frac{9}{5} = \frac{52}{15}$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{67}$"

2. One of the numbers (let's assume it is \(a\)) is divisible by \(10\).
3. If the units digit of \(a\) is erased, the other number \(b\) is obtained.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Since \(a\) is divisible by \(10\), it can be written as \(a = 10k\) for some integer \(k\).
2. The number \(b\) is obtained by erasing the units digit of \(a\), which means \(b = k\).

Given these, we can write the equation for the sum:
\[ a + b = 10k + k = 11k = 17402 \]

From this, we can solve for \(k\):
\[ 11k = 17402 \]
\[ k = \frac{17402}{11} \]

# Given sum of the two numbers

# Calculate k
k = sum_ab // 11

# Calculate the two numbers
a = 10 * k

### Solution: To solve the problem, let's denote the two natural numbers as \(a\) and \(b\).

Given:
1. The sum of the two numbers is \(17402\): \(a + b = 17402\).
2. One of the numbers (let's assume it is \(a\)) is divisible by \(10\).
3. If the units digit of \(a\) is erased, the other number \(b\) is obtained.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. Since \(a\) is divisible by \(10\), it can be written as \(a = 10k\) for some integer \(k\).
2. The number \(b\) is obtained by erasing the units digit of \(a\), which means \(b = k\).

Given these, we can write the equation for the sum:
\[ a + b = 10k + k = 11k = 17402 \]

From this, we can solve for \(k\):
\[ 11k = 17402 \]
\[ k = \frac{17402}{11} \]

Let's calculate \(k\) using Python and then find \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, we will compute the difference \(a - b\).
```python
# Given sum of the two numbers
sum_ab = 17402

# Calculate k
k = sum_ab // 11

# Calculate the two numbers
a = 10 * k
b = k

# Calculate the difference
difference = a - b
print((difference, a, b))
```

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled by the cart in 30 seconds, given that it travels 5 inches in the first second and accelerates such that each successive 1-second interval sees it travel 7 inches more than the previous second.

This forms an arithmetic sequence where the distance traveled in each second forms the terms of the sequence.

Let's denote the distance traveled in the \(n\)-th second as \(a_n\).

Given:
- \(a_1 = 5\)
- The common difference \(d = 7\)

The distance traveled in the \(n\)-th second can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

The total distance traveled in \(30\) seconds is the sum of the first 30 terms of this arithmetic sequence:
\[ S_{30} = \sum_{n=1}^{30} a_n \]

The sum of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (2a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d) \]

   To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \(f(x, y)\) with respect to \(x\) and \(y\), set them to zero, and solve the resulting system of equations.

3. **Evaluate the Expression at the Critical Points:**
   Calculate the value of the expression at the critical points to determine the minimum value.

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy to find the least possible value of the given expression.

```python

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( B \) in the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) given that all the roots are positive integers.

Let's denote the roots by \( r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_6 \). Since the polynomial has a constant term of 16, the product of the roots must be 16. We need to find six positive integer roots that multiply to 16.

The possible sets of positive integer roots that multiply to 16 are:
- \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8 \)
- \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4 \)
- \( 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2 \)
- \( 1, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2 \)
- \( 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2 \)

We will use Vieta's formulas to find the coefficients of the polynomial. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

Let's use the first set of roots: \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 8 \).

1. The sum of the roots (taken one at a time) is:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 14
   \]
   This gives us \( A = 14 \).

2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:
   \[","By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the six roots is $10$ and the product of the six roots is $16$ . By inspection, we see the roots are $1, 1, 2, 2, 2,$ and $2$ , so the function is $(z-1)^2(z-2)^4=(z^2-2z+1)(z^4-8z^3+24z^2-32z+16)$ . Therefore, calculating just the $z^3$ terms, we get $B = -32 - 48 - 8 = \boxed{88}$"

Notice that, since $D \ne B$ , this expression can never equal $0$ , and since $A \ne C$ , there won't be a divide-by- $0$ .

Given this structure, the median of the list can be determined by finding the position of the median in the ordered list.

1. **Calculate the total number of elements:**
   The total number of elements in the list is the sum of the integers from 1 to 200. This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
   \[
   \text{Total number of elements} = \sum_{k=1}^{200} k = \frac{200 \cdot (200 + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Determine the median position:**
   Since the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the elements at positions \(\left(\frac{N}{2}\right)\) and \(\left(\frac{N}{2} + 1\right)\), where \( N \) is the total number of elements.

3. **Find the values at these positions:**
   Using the structure of the list, determine the values at the median positions.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of trapezoids, triangles, and the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Trapezoid \(ABCD\) has \(AB \parallel CD\), \(BC = CD = 43\), and \(AD \perp BD\).
   - \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - \(P\) is the midpoint of \(BD\).
   - Given \(OP = 11\), we need to find the length of \(AD\) which is in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\).

2. **Using Properties of Trapezoids and Triangles:**
   - Since \(AD \perp BD\), \(\triangle ABD\) is a right triangle.
   - Let \(AD = h\). Since \(BC = CD = 43\) and \(AB \parallel CD\), the height from \(A\) to \(BD\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(BD\).

3. **Using the Midpoint and Given Conditions:**

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of trapezoids, triangles, and the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Trapezoid \(ABCD\) has \(AB \parallel CD\), \(BC = CD = 43\), and \(AD \perp BD\).
   - \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - \(P\) is the midpoint of \(BD\).
   - Given \(OP = 11\), we need to find the length of \(AD\) which is in the form \(m\sqrt{n}\).

2. **Using Properties of Trapezoids and Triangles:**
   - Since \(AD \perp BD\), \(\triangle ABD\) is a right triangle.
   - Let \(AD = h\). Since \(BC = CD = 43\) and \(AB \parallel CD\), the height from \(A\) to \(BD\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(BD\).

3. **Using the Midpoint and Given Conditions:**
   - Since \(P\) is the midpoint of \(BD\), \(BP = PD = \frac{BD}{2}\).
   - Given \(OP = 11\), where \(O\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
","Since $\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with base $\overline{BD},$ it follows that median $\overline{CP}$ is also an altitude. Let $OD=x$ and $CP=h,$ so $PB=x+11.$
Since $\angle AOD=\angle COP$ by vertical angles, we conclude that $\triangle AOD\sim\triangle COP$ by AA, from which $\frac{AD}{CP}=\frac{OD}{OP},$ or \[AD=CP\cdot\frac{OD}{OP}=h\cdot\frac{x}{11}.\] Let the brackets denote areas. Notice that $[AOD]=[BOC]$ (By the same base and height, we deduce that $[ACD]=[BDC].$ Subtracting $[OCD]$ from both sides gives $[AOD]=[BOC].$ ). Doubling both sides produces \begin{align*} 2[AOD]&=2[BOC] \\ OD\cdot AD&=OB\cdot CP \\ x\left(\frac{hx}{11}\right)&=(x+22)h \\ x^2&=11(x+22). \end{align*} Rearranging and factoring result in $(x-22)(x+11)=0,$ from which $x=22.$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right $\triangle CPB,$ we have \[h=\sqrt{43^2-33^2}=\sqrt{(43+33)(43-33)}=\sqrt{760}=2\sqrt{190}.\] Finally, we get \[AD=h\cdot\frac{x}{11}=4\sqrt{190},\] so the answer is $4+190=\boxed{194}.$"

","Observe that $\triangle BPC$ is congruent to $\triangle DPC$ ; both are similar to $\triangle BDA$ . Let's extend $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ past points $D$ and $C$ respectively, such that they intersect at a point $E$ . Observe that $\angle BDE$ is $90$ degrees, and that $\angle DBE \cong \angle PBC \cong \angle DBA \implies \angle DBE \cong \angle DBA$ . Thus, by ASA, we know that $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle EBD$ , thus, $AD = ED$ , meaning $D$ is the midpoint of $AE$ .
Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{DE}$ . Note that $\triangle CME$ is congruent to $\triangle BPC$ , thus $BC = CE$ , meaning $C$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BE}.$
Therefore, $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ are both medians of $\triangle ABE$ . This means that $O$ is the centroid of $\triangle ABE$ ; therefore, because the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, $\frac{BO}{2} = DO = \frac{BD}{3}$ . Recall that $P$ is the midpoint of $BD$ $DP = \frac{BD}{2}$ . The question tells us that $OP = 11$ $DP-DO=11$ ; we can write this in terms of $DB$ $\frac{DB}{2}-\frac{DB}{3} = \frac{DB}{6} = 11 \implies DB = 66$
We are almost finished. Each side length of $\triangle ABD$ is twice as long as the corresponding side length $\triangle CBP$ or $\triangle CPD$ , since those triangles are similar; this means that $AB = 2 \cdot 43 = 86$ . Now, by Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle ABD$ $AB^{2} - BD^{2} = AD^{2} \implies 86^{2}-66^{2} = AD^{2} \implies AD = \sqrt{3040} \implies AD = 4 \sqrt{190}$

Since $P$ is the midpoint of $BD$ , the height of $\triangle APB$ on side $AB$ is half that of $\triangle ADC$ on $CD$ . Since $[APB]=[ADC]$ $AB=2CD$

Then let the coordinates of $B = (2a,0), A = (0, -2b).$ Then the slope of $AB$ is $\frac{b}{a}.$ Since $AB \parallel CD$ the slope of $CD$ is the same. Note that as $\triangle DCB$ is isosceles $C$ lies on $x = a.$ Thus since $CD$ has equation $y = \frac{b}{a}x$ $D$ is the origin), $C = (a,b).$ Therefore $AC$ has equation $y = \frac{3b}{a}x - 2b$ and intersects $BD$ $x$ -axis) at $O =\left(\frac{2}{3}a, 0\right).$ The midpoint of $BD$ is $P = (a,0),$ so $OP = \frac{a}{3} = 11,$ from which $a = 33.$ Then by Pythagorean theorem on $\triangle DPC$ $\triangle DBC$ is isosceles), we have $b = \sqrt{43^2 - 33^2} = 2\sqrt{190},$ so $2b=4\sqrt{190}.$

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation involves absolute values, which means we need to consider different cases based on the signs of \(x-y\) and \(x+y\).

2. **Consider Different Cases:**
   We need to consider the following cases for the absolute values:
   - Case 1: \(x - y \geq 0\) and \(x + y \geq 0\)
   - Case 2: \(x - y \geq 0\) and \(x + y \leq 0\)
   - Case 3: \(x - y \leq 0\) and \(x + y \geq 0\)
   - Case 4: \(x - y \leq 0\) and \(x + y \leq 0\)

3. **Solve Each Case:**
   For each case, we will remove the absolute values and solve the resulting equations.

4. **Find the Boundary of the Region:**
   We will find the equations of the boundaries formed by the solutions of each case.

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   We will calculate the area of the region bounded by these equations.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to handle the algebraic manipulations and calculate the area.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the equation
equation = x**2 + y**2 - 3*abs(x - y) - 3","In order to attack this problem, we can use casework on the sign of $|x-y|$ and $|x+y|$
Case 1: $|x-y|=x-y, |x+y|=x+y$
Substituting and simplifying, we have $x^2-6x+y^2=0$ , i.e. $(x-3)^2+y^2=3^2$ , which gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(3,0)$
Case 2: $|x-y|=y-x, |x+y|=x+y$
Substituting and simplifying again, we have $x^2+y^2-6y=0$ , i.e. $x^2+(y-3)^2=3^2$ . This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(0,3)$
Case 3: $|x-y|=x-y, |x+y|=-x-y$
Doing the same process as before, we have $x^2+y^2+6y=0$ , i.e. $x^2+(y+3)^2=3^2$ . This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(0,-3)$
Case 4: $|x-y|=y-x, |x+y|=-x-y$
One last time: we have $x^2+y^2+6x=0$ , i.e. $(x+3)^2+y^2=3^2$ . This gives us a circle of radius $3$ centered at $(-3,0)$
After combining all the cases and drawing them on the Cartesian Plane, this is what the diagram looks like:
[asy] size(10cm);  Label f;  f.p=fontsize(7); xaxis(-8,8,Ticks(f, 1.0));  yaxis(-8,8,Ticks(f, 1.0));  draw(arc((-3,0),3,90,270) -- cycle, gray); draw(arc((0,3),3,0,180) -- cycle, gray); draw(arc((3,0),3,-90,90) -- cycle, gray); draw(arc((0,-3),3,-180,0) -- cycle, gray); draw((-3,3)--(3,3)--(3,-3)--(-3,-3)--cycle, grey); [/asy] Now, the area of the shaded region is just a square with side length $6$ with four semicircles of radius $3$ .

This allows us to quickly sketch the region after solving Case 1.
Upon simplifying Case 1, we obtain $(x-3)^2 + y^2 = 3^2$ which is a circle of radius 3 centered at $(3,0)$ . We remark that only the points on the semicircle where $x \ge 3$ work here, since Case 1 assumes $x-y \ge 0$ and $x+y \ge 0$ . Next, we observe that an ordered pair is a solution to the given equation if and only if any of its $90^{\circ}$ rotations about the origin is a solution. This follows as the value of $x^2+y^2-3(|x-y|+|x+y|)$ is invariant to $90^{\circ}$ rotations, since $x^2+y^2$ simply represents the square of the distance to the origin (which is unchanged upon rotation), and $|x-y|+|x+y|$ is the sum of the distances to the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$ , multiplied by $\sqrt{2}$ (also unchanged upon $90^{\circ}$ rotation).

$\textbf{(A)} ~18\qquad\textbf{(B)} ~27\qquad\textbf{(C)} ~36\qquad\textbf{(D)} ~45\qquad\textbf{(E)} ~54$
### Solution: To solve the given problem, we need to analyze the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 3|x-y| + 3|x+y|\) and determine the area of the region it describes.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation involves absolute values, which means we need to consider different cases based on the signs of \(x-y\) and \(x+y\).

2. **Consider Different Cases:**
   We need to consider the following cases for the absolute values:
   - Case 1: \(x - y \geq 0\) and \(x + y \geq 0\)
   - Case 2: \(x - y \geq 0\) and \(x + y \leq 0\)
   - Case 3: \(x - y \leq 0\) and \(x + y \geq 0\)
   - Case 4: \(x - y \leq 0\) and \(x + y \leq 0\)

3. **Solve Each Case:**
   For each case, we will remove the absolute values and solve the resulting equations.

4. **Find the Boundary of the Region:**
   We will find the equations of the boundaries formed by the solutions of each case.

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   We will calculate the area of the region bounded by these equations.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to handle the algebraic manipulations and calculate the area.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the equation
equation = x**2 + y**2 - 3*abs(x - y) - 3","Assume $y$ $0$ . We get that $x$ $6$ . That means that this figure must contain the points $(0,6), (6,0), (0, -6), (-6, 0)$ . Now, assume that $x$ $y$ . We get that $x$ $3 \sqrt 3$ . We get the points $(3,3), (3,-3), (-3, 3), (-3, -3)$
Since this contains $x^2 + y^2$ , assume that there are circles. Therefore, we can guess that there is a center square with area $6 \cdot 6$ $36$ and $4$ semicircles with radius $3$ . We get $4$ semicircles with area $4.5 \pi$ , and therefore the answer is $36+18$ $\boxed{54}$"

Find the total, and multiply by 2. Then we can get the answer by adding the case when 5 is the third digit.
Case $1$ 5 is the 5th digit. __ __ __ __ 5
Then $4$ can only be either 1st digit or the 3rd digit.
4 __ __ __ 5, then the only way is that $3$ is the 3rd digit, so it can be either $231$ or $132$ , give us $2$ results.
__ __ 4 __ 5, then the 1st digit must be $2$ or $3$ $2$ gives us $1$ way, and $3$ gives us $2$ ways. (Can't be $1$ because the first digit would increasing). Therefore, $4$ in the middle and $5$ in the last would result in $3$ ways.
Case $2$ $5$ is the fourth digit. __ __ __ 5 __
Then the last digit can be all of the 4 numbers $1$ $2$ $3$ , and $4$ . Let's say if the last digit is $4$ , then the 2nd digit would be the largest for the remaining digits to prevent increasing order or decreasing order. Then the remaining two are interchangeable, give us $2!$ ways. All of the $4$ can work, so case $2$ would result in $2!+2!+2!+2!=8$ ways.
Case $3$ $5$ is in the middle. __ __ 5 __ __
Then there are only two cases:

Therefore, case 3 would result in $4+2=6$ ways.
$8+3+2=13$ , so the total ways for case 1 and case 2 with both increasing and decreasing would be $13*2=26.$
Finally, we have $26+6=\boxed{32}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutations of the sequence \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\) such that no three consecutive terms are increasing or decreasing.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Generate All Permutations:**
   First, generate all permutations of the sequence \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\).

2. **Check Conditions:**
   For each permutation, check if there are no three consecutive terms that are either all increasing or all decreasing.

3. **Count Valid Permutations:**
   Count the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions.

Let's implement this in Python using the `sympy` library.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all permutations of the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
permutations = list(itertools.permutations(sequence))

# Function to check if a permutation has no three consecutive increasing or decreasing terms
def is_valid(permutation):
    for i in range(len(permutation) - 2):
        if (permutation[i] < permutation[i+1] < permutation[i+2]) or (permutation[i] > permutation[i+1] > permutation[i+2]):
            return False
    return True

# Count valid permutations
valid_permutations = [perm for perm in permutations if is_valid(perm)]
valid_count = len(valid_permutations)

print(valid_count)
```
```output
18
```
The number of ways to rearrange the sequence \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\) such that no three consecutive terms are increasing and no three","First, we list the triples that are invalid:
543, 542, 541, 532, 531, 521, 432, 431, 321
By symmetry, there are the same amount of increasing triplets as there are decreasing ones. This yields 18 invalid 3 digit permutations in total.
Suppose the triplet is ABC and the other 2 digits are X and Y. We then have 3 ways to arrange a triplet with 2 other digits.
ABCXY, XABCY, XYABC
X and Y can be arranged 2 ways.
XY, YX
This produces 18*3*2=108 permutations of invalid results. We have 5!
ways to arrange 5 numbers so 120-108=12.
Now, we must account for overcounting. For example, when 543 is counted,
it only registers as one invalid permutation but in fact, it is 3 whole
invalid permutations. We then complete this for the rest of the list:
54321 has 543, 432, and 321
54213 has 542 and 421
54123 has 541 and 123
53214 has 532 and 321
53124 has 531 and 124
52134 has 521 and 134
43215 has 432 and 321
43125 has 431 and 125
32145 has 321 and 145
This produces 19 values that we have overcounted but this value itself is also overcounted. We already counted 9 of the terms. This brings the final value of overcounted terms down to 10 for the decreasing triplets. By symmetry, 10 increasing triplets were overcounted.
This gives us $120-108+20=\boxed{32}.$"

First, write down the sets of three numbers that feature the numbers in increasing order. They are 123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 245, 345. Each of these can be in three positions: the three are in the front with two more numbers in the back, the three are in the middle with two on each side, and two in the front and the set of three in the back. Now, count the number of combinations of 5 numbers that each of the set of three can form that have no been previously accounted for. Also, if the set features both 3 increasing and 3 decreasing, then do not count it because we will separately count them.
\[\begin{tabular}[t]{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Three Increasing Numbers&Front&Middle&Back\\\hline 123&2&2&2\\\hline 124&2&2&2\\\hline 125&1&2&2\\\hline 134&2&2&2\\\hline 135&1&2&2\\\hline 145&1&2&2\\\hline 234&2&1&1\\\hline 245&1&1&1\\\hline 345&1&0&1\\\hline \end{tabular}\]
This gives us a total of 41 possibilities. These account for the possibilities with ONLY increasing numbers. Mirror over to the other side to get the set of combinations with either at least 1 set of 3 increasing numbers in a row or only at least 1 set of 3 decreasing numbers, but not both. We can count the ones with both separately. 14532, 12543, 13542, 54123, 53124, 52134. Total of 6.
$41*2+6=82+6=88$ . This is the compliment. There are a total of $5!=120$ $120-88=32$

Now, consider the placement of 5 in the $+,-,+,-$ case. Clearly, 5 is the maximum value, so it must be placed in the 2nd position or the 4th position, but we also have symmetry $a, b, c, d, e \leftrightarrow e, d, c, b, a$ . We will find the number of sequences with 5 in the second position by using casework on the position of the 4.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of an equiangular hexagon and the given areas of the triangles formed by the lines \(AB, CD, EF\) and \(BC, DE, FA\).

Given:
1. The hexagon \(ABCDEF\) is equiangular.
2. The area of the triangle formed by lines \(AB, CD, EF\) is \(192\sqrt{3}\).
3. The area of the triangle formed by lines \(BC, DE, FA\) is \(324\sqrt{3}\).

Since the hexagon is equiangular, each internal angle is \(120^\circ\). The lines \(AB, CD, EF\) and \(BC, DE, FA\) form triangles that are centrally similar to the hexagon.

Let's denote the side lengths of the hexagon as \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) in cyclic order.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Equiangular Hexagon Properties:**
   - The area of an equiangular hexagon with side lengths \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) can be related to the triangles formed by the lines.

2. **Area of Triangles:**
   - The area of a triangle formed by three sides of the hexagon can be related to the side lengths.

3. **Using Given Areas:**
   - We know the areas of the triangles formed by the lines \(AB, CD, EF\)","Let $P,Q,R,X,Y,$ and $Z$ be the intersections $\overleftrightarrow{AB}\cap\overleftrightarrow{CD},\overleftrightarrow{CD}\cap\overleftrightarrow{EF},\overleftrightarrow{EF}\cap\overleftrightarrow{AB},\overleftrightarrow{BC}\cap\overleftrightarrow{DE},\overleftrightarrow{DE}\cap\overleftrightarrow{FA},$ and $\overleftrightarrow{FA}\cap\overleftrightarrow{BC},$ respectively.
The sum of the interior angles of any hexagon is $720^\circ.$ Since hexagon $ABCDEF$ is equiangular, each of its interior angles is $720^\circ\div6=120^\circ.$ By angle chasing, we conclude that the interior angles of $\triangle PBC,\triangle QDE,\triangle RFA,\triangle XCD,\triangle YEF,$ and $\triangle ZAB$ are all $60^\circ.$ Therefore, these triangles are all equilateral triangles, from which $\triangle PQR$ and $\triangle XYZ$ are both equilateral triangles.
We are given that \begin{alignat*}{8} [PQR]&=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\cdot PQ^2&&=192\sqrt3, \\ [XYZ]&=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\cdot YZ^2&&=324\sqrt3, \end{alignat*} so we get $PQ=16\sqrt3$ and $YZ=36,$ respectively.
By equilateral triangles and segment addition, we find the perimeter of hexagon $ABCDEF:$ \begin{align*} AB+BC+CD+DE+EF+FA&=AZ+PC+CD+DQ+YF+FA \\ &=(YF+FA+AZ)+(PC+CD+DQ) \\ &=YZ+PQ \\ &=36+16\sqrt{3}. \end{align*} Finally, the answer is $36+16+3=\boxed{55}.$"

   The sum of the page numbers on the borrowed sheets can be calculated by summing the page numbers from sheet \( s \) to sheet \( s + b - 1 \).

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The average of the remaining page numbers is given as 19. Therefore, the sum of the remaining page numbers divided by the number of remaining sheets should equal 19.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for \( b \).

```","Let $n$ be the number of sheets borrowed, with an average page number $k+25.5$ . The remaining $25-n$ sheets have an average page number of $19$ which is less than $25.5$ , the average page number of all $50$ pages, therefore $k>0$ . Since the borrowed sheets start with an odd page number and end with an even page number we have $k \in \mathbb N$ . We notice that $n < 25$ and $k \le (49+50)/2-25.5=24<25$
The weighted increase of average page number from $25.5$ to $k+25.5$ should be equal to the weighted decrease of average page number from $25.5$ to $19$ , where the weights are the page number in each group (borrowed vs. remained), therefore
\[2nk=2(25-n)(25.5-19)=13(25-n) \implies 13 | n \text{ or } 13 | k\]
Since $n, k < 25$ we have either $n=13$ or $k=13$ . If $n=13$ then $k=6$ . If $k=13$ then $2n=25-n$ which is impossible. Therefore the answer should be $n=\boxed{13}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sheets were borrowed such that the average page number on the remaining sheets is exactly 19.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the Page Numbers:**
   Each sheet contains two pages. The first sheet contains pages 1 and 2, the second sheet contains pages 3 and 4, and so on.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   Let \( b \) be the number of borrowed sheets, and let \( s \) be the starting sheet number of the borrowed sheets.

3. **Calculate the Remaining Page Numbers:**
   The total number of sheets is 25, so the number of remaining sheets is \( 25 - b \).

4. **Sum of Page Numbers:**
   The sum of the page numbers on all 25 sheets can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Borrowed Sheets:**
   The sum of the page numbers on the borrowed sheets can be calculated by summing the page numbers from sheet \( s \) to sheet \( s + b - 1 \).

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The average of the remaining page numbers is given as 19. Therefore, the sum of the remaining page numbers divided by the number of remaining sheets should equal 19.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for \( b \).

```","Let $(2k-1)-2n$ be pages be borrowed, the sum of the page numbers on those pages is $(2n+2k+1)(n-k)$ while the sum of the rest pages is $1275-(2n+2k+1)(n-k)$ and we know the average of the rest is $\frac{1275-(2n+2k+1)}{50-2n+2k}$ which equals to $19$ ; multiply this out we got $950-38(n-k)=1275-(2n+2k+1)(n-k)$ and we got $(2n+2k-37)(n-k)=325$ .

```","Let $c$ be the number of consecutive sheets Hiram’s roommate borrows, and let $b$ be the number of sheets preceding the $c$ borrowed sheets (i.e. if the friend borrows sheets $3$ $4$ , and $5$ , then $c=3$ and $b=2$ ).
The sum of the page numbers up till $b$ sheets is $1+2+3+\cdots + 2b=\frac{2b\cdot(2b+1)}{2} = b(2b+1)$ .
The last page number of the borrowed sheets would be $2(b+c)$ . Therefore, the sum of the remaining page numbers of the sheets after the $c$ borrowed sheets would be $2(b+c)+1 + 2(b+c)+2+\cdots+50$
The total number of page numbers after the borrow would be $50-2c$
Thus the average of the page numbers after the borrow would be: \[\frac{b(2b+1)+ 2(b+c)+1 + 2(b+c)+2+\cdots+50}{50-2c} =19.\] By the arithmetic series formula, this turns out to be: \[\frac{b(2b+1)+ \frac{(2(b+c)+1+50)\cdot(50-2c-2b)}{2}}{50-2c} =19\] because in the changed sum, there are $50$ numbers minus $2c$ borrowed numbers and $2b$ numbers from the first $b$ sheets.
This simplifies to \[\frac{b(2b+1)+ (2(b+c)+51)\cdot(25-c-b)}{50-2c} =19 \implies 19(50-2c)= b(2b+1)+ (2b+2c+51)\cdot(25-c-b).\] Noticing that some terms will cancel, we expand, leading to: \[950-38c=2b^2+b+50b-2bc-2b^2+50c-2c^2-2bc+1275-51c-51b\] \[\implies 950-38c=1275-4bc-c-2c^2 \implies 2c^2+4b-37c=325.\] Factoring, we get \[c(2c+4b-37)=325.\] The prime factorization of 325 is $5^2\cdot13$ . Recall that $0\leq c \leq 25$ , so $c$ could be $1$ $5$ $13$ , or $25$
We can rule out $c=25$ since Hiram would have no paper left over, so the average of the page numbers he has would be $0$ . We can now plug in the other answers for $c$ and we if we get a valid answer for $b$
Finally, just to make sure, we test $c=13 \implies 26+4b-37=25 \implies 4b=36 \implies b=9$
$b$ is an integer and $b+c=22$ , so everything checks out. The number of consecutive sheets borrowed by Hiram’s friend is $c=\boxed{13}$"

```","The sum of all the page numbers is \[1+2+3+\cdots+50 = 1275.\] If we add the page numbers on each sheet, we get this sequence: \[3, 7, 11, \ldots, 99.\] So we can write the sum of the numbers on the first sheet that the roommate borrowed as $4n+3$ for some nonnegative integer, $n$ . If the roommate borrowed $k$ sheets, he borrowed sheets \[4n+3, 4n+7, \ldots, 4n+4k-1.\] The sum of the numbers in this sequence is \[\frac{k(8n+4k+2)}{2} = 4nk+2k^2+k.\] Since there are $2$ pages per sheet, there are $50-2k$ pages remaining, so the average page number of the remaining sheets is \[\frac{1275 - (4nk+2k^2+k)}{50-2k}.\] Therefore, \[\frac{1275 - (4nk+2k^2+k)}{50-2k} = 19,\] which simplifies to \[2k^2-37k-325 = -4nk.\] Factoring the left-hand side, \[(2k+13)(k-25)=-4nk.\] Since the right-hand side of this equation is divisible by $k$ , the left-hand side must also be divisible by $k$
In order for $(2k+13)(k-25)$ to be divisible by $k$ , either $2k+13$ or $k-25$ must be divisible by $k$ \[\frac{2k+13}{k}=2+\frac{13}{k},\] so $2k+13$ is divisible by $k$ only if $k$ is a factor of $13$ \[\frac{k-25}{k}=1-\frac{25}{k},\] so $k-25$ is divisible by $k$ only if $k$ is a factor of $25$
None of the answer choices are factors of $25$ , but answer choice B is a factor of $13$ . Hence, the answer is $\boxed{13}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 3 indistinguishable red chips, 3 indistinguishable blue chips, and 3 indistinguishable green chips in a \(3 \times 3\) grid such that no two chips of the same color are directly adjacent to each other, either vertically or horizontally.

We can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - No two chips of the same color should be adjacent vertically or horizontally.
   - This means that each color should be distributed in such a way that no two chips of the same color are adjacent.

2. **Symmetry and Permutations:**
   - Since the chips of each color are indistinguishable, we need to account for the permutations of the colors.

3. **Possible Configurations:**
   - We need to find all valid configurations of placing the chips and then count the permutations.

Let's implement this step-by-step using Python and SymPy.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_grid(grid):
    # Check if no two chips of the same color are adjacent vertically or horizontally
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if i < 2 and grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j]: # Check horizontal adjacency
            if j < 2 and grid[i][j] == grid[i][j+1]: # Check vertical adjacency
                return False
    return True

# All possible positions for the chips
positions = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3)]

# Generate all permutations of the positions for the 9 chips
all_permutations = itertools.permutations(positions)
","Call the different colors A,B,C. There are $3!=6$ ways to rearrange these colors to these three letters, so $6$ must be multiplied after the letters are permuted in the grid. 
WLOG assume that A is in the center. \[\begin{tabular}{ c c c }  ? & ? & ? \\   ? & A & ? \\    ? & ? & ?     \end{tabular}\] In this configuration, there are two cases, either all the A's lie on the same diagonal: \[\begin{tabular}{ c c c }  ? & ? & A \\   ? & A & ? \\    A & ? & ?     \end{tabular}\] or all the other two A's are on adjacent corners: \[\begin{tabular}{ c c c }  A & ? & A \\   ? & A & ? \\    ? & ? & ?     \end{tabular}\] In the first case there are two ways to order them since there are two diagonals, and in the second case there are four ways to order them since there are four pairs of adjacent corners.
In each case there is only one way to put the three B's and the three C's as shown in the diagrams. \[\begin{tabular}{ c c c }   C & B & A \\    B & A & C \\     A & C & B     \end{tabular}\] \[\begin{tabular}{ c c c }  A & B & A \\   C & A & C \\    B & C & B     \end{tabular}\] This means that there are $4+2=6$ ways to arrange A,B, and C in the grid, and there are $6$ ways to rearrange the colors.

$\textbf{(A)} ~12\qquad\textbf{(B)} ~18\qquad\textbf{(C)} ~24\qquad\textbf{(D)} ~30\qquad\textbf{(E)} ~36$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 3 indistinguishable red chips, 3 indistinguishable blue chips, and 3 indistinguishable green chips in a \(3 \times 3\) grid such that no two chips of the same color are directly adjacent to each other, either vertically or horizontally.

We can break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - No two chips of the same color should be adjacent vertically or horizontally.
   - This means that each color should be distributed in such a way that no two chips of the same color are adjacent.

2. **Symmetry and Permutations:**
   - Since the chips of each color are indistinguishable, we need to account for the permutations of the colors.

3. **Possible Configurations:**
   - We need to find all valid configurations of placing the chips and then count the permutations.

Let's implement this step-by-step using Python and SymPy.

","Case (1) : We have a permutation of R, B, and G as all of the rows. There are $3!$ ways to rearrange these three colors. After finishing the first row, we move onto the second. Notice how the second row must be a derangement of the first one. By the derangement formula, $\frac{3!}{e} \approx 2$ , so there are two possible permutations of the second row. (Note: You could have also found the number of derangements of PIE). Finally, there are $2$ possible permutations for the last row. Thus, there are $3!\cdot2\cdot2=24$ possibilities.
Case (2) : All of the rows have two chips that are the same color and one that is different. There are obviously $3$ possible configurations for the first row, $2$ for the second, and $2$ for the third. Thus, there are $3\cdot2\cdot2=12$ possibilities.

$\textbf{(A)} ~9 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~10 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~18 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~19 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~20$
### Solution: To solve the problem of finding how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the value of \( 3\pi \).
2. Determine the integer bounds within which \( |x| < 3\pi \).
3. Count the integer values within this range.

Let's start by calculating \( 3\pi \). We'll use Python for this calculation to ensure accuracy.
```python
import math

# Calculate 3π
upper_bound = 3 * math.pi
print(upper_bound)
```
```output
9.42477796076938
```
The value of \( 3\pi \) is approximately \( 9.4248 \).

Next, we need to find the integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \). This means:
\[ -9.4248 < x < 9.4248 \]

We need to count the integer values within this range. The smallest integer greater than \(-9.4248\) is \(-9\), and the largest integer less than \(9.4248\) is \(9\).

Now, we will count the integers from \(-9\) to \(9\).
```python
# Determine the smallest and largest integer within the bound
lower_bound = math.ceil(-upper_bound)
upper_bound = math.floor(upper_bound)

# Count the number of integers within this range
num_integers = upper_bound - lower_bound + 1
print((lower_bound, upper_bound, num_integers))
```
```output
(-9, 9, 19)
```
The integer bounds within which \( |x| < 3\pi \) are from \(-9\) to \(9\). The number of integers within this range is:","There are an odd number of integer solutions $x$ to this inequality since if any non-zero integer $x$ satisfies this inequality, then so does $-x,$ and we must also account for $0,$ which gives us the desired. Then, the answer is either $\textbf{(A)}$ or $\textbf{(D)},$ and since $3 \pi > 3 \cdot 3 > 9,$ the answer is at least $9 \cdot 2 + 1 = 19,$ yielding $\boxed{19}.$"

- 10% of the seniors are on the debate team.
- The number of juniors and seniors on the debate team is equal.

```output

Cross-multiplying and simplifying we get $5j=2s.$ Additionally, since there are $28$ students in the program, $j+s = 28.$ It is now a matter of solving the system of equations \[5j=2s\] \[j+s=28,\] and the solution is $j = 8, s = 20.$ Since we want the number of juniors, the answer is \[\boxed{8}.\]"

$\textbf{(A)} ~23 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~32 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~37 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~41 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~64$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pairs consist of two students wearing yellow shirts.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Total Pairs:** There are \(66\) pairs in total.
2. **Pairs with Blue Shirts:** There are \(23\) pairs where both students are wearing blue shirts.
3. **Pairs with Yellow Shirts:** We need to find the number of pairs where both students are wearing yellow shirts.

First, we can calculate the number of pairs where at least one student is wearing a blue shirt:
\[ \text{Pairs with at least one blue shirt} = 66 - 23 = 43 \]

Since there are \(57\) students wearing blue shirts, and these are paired with \(43\) students wearing either blue or yellow shirts, we can set up the following equation for the number of students in pairs with at least one blue shirt:
\[ 2 \times 23 (\text{both blue}) + x (\text{one blue, one yellow}) = 57 \]
\[ 46 + x = 57 \]
\[ x = 57 - 46 = 11 \]

So, there are \(11\) pairs where one student is wearing a blue shirt and the other is wearing a yellow shirt.

Now, we know:
- \(23\) pairs have both students wearing blue shirts.
- \(11\) pairs have one student wearing a blue shirt and one wearing a yellow shirt.

To find the number of pairs with both students wearing yellow shirts, we subtract the number of known pairs from the total number of pairs:
\[ \text{Pairs with yellow shirts} = 66 - 23",There are $46$ students paired with a blue partner. The other $11$ students wearing blue shirts must each be paired with a partner wearing a shirt of the opposite color. There are $64$ students remaining.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find four distinct single-digit positive integers whose products in pairs give us the numbers 24 and 30. Let's denote the ages of the four cousins by \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \).

Given:
1. \( ab = 24 \)
2. \( cd = 24 \)
3. \( ef = 30 \)

We need to find the sum \( a + b + c + d \).

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify pairs for 24 and 30:**
   - For \( ab = 24 \), the pairs of single-digit integers are: \( (3, 8) \) and \( (4, 6) \).
   - For \( cd = 24 \), the pairs can be the same as above since both pairs consist of distinct integers.
   - For \( ef = 30 \), the pairs of single-digit integers are: \( (5, 6) \).

2. **Check distinct pairs:**
   - We need to ensure that the pairs are distinct when combined.

Let's implement this in Python to find the valid combination of ages.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Possible pairs for the given products
pairs_24 = [(3, 8), (4, 6)]
pair_30 = [(5, 6)]

# Function to check if the combination of pairs is valid
def is_valid_combination(pairs):
    ages = set()
    for pair in pairs:
        ages.update(pair)
    return len(ages) == 4

# Find all possible combinations of pairs
possible_combinations =","First look at the two cousins' ages that multiply to $24$ . Since the ages must be single-digit, the ages must either be $3 \text{ and } 8$ or $4 \text{ and } 6.$
Next, look at the two cousins' ages that multiply to $30$ . Since the ages must be single-digit, the only ages that work are $5 \text{ and } 6.$ Remembering that all the ages must all be distinct, the only solution that works is when the ages are $3, 8$ and $5, 6$
We are required to find the sum of the ages, which is \[3 + 8 + 5 + 6 = \boxed{22}.\]"

The mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is $84$ , and the afternoon class's mean score is $70$ . The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is $\frac{3}{4}$ . What is the mean of the scores of all the students?
$\textbf{(A)} ~74 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~75 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~76 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~77 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~78$
### Solution: To find the mean score of all students combined, we need to use the given information about the means and the ratio of the number of students in the two classes.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the number of students in the morning class.
- \( A \) as the number of students in the afternoon class.
- \( \bar{S}_M \) as the mean score of the morning class, which is 84.
- \( \bar{S}_A \) as the mean score of the afternoon class, which is 70.
- The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), so \( M = \frac{3}{4}A \).

We need to find the combined mean score, \(\bar{S}_{total}\), of all students. The combined mean can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\bar{S}_{total} = \frac{M \cdot \bar{S}_M + A \cdot \bar{S}_A}{M + A}
\]

First, let's express \( M \) in terms of \( A \):

\[
M = \frac{3}{4}A
\]

Now, substitute \( M \) and the given mean scores into the combined mean formula:

\[
\bar{S}_{total} = \frac{\left(\frac{3}{4}A\right) \cdot 84 + A \cdot 70}{\left(\frac{3}{4}A\right) + A}
\]

Let's simplify and calculate this using Python.
```python

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to maximize the area of region \( S \) which consists of points lying inside exactly one of the four circles. Let's break down the problem and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We have four circles with radii \(1, 3, 5,\) and \(7\) which are tangent to a line \(\ell\) at the same point \( A \). The circles may be on either side of the line. We need to find the maximum possible area of region \( S \), which includes points lying inside exactly one of these circles.

2. **Configuration of Circles:**
   To maximize the area of \( S \), we need to consider how to place the circles such that they cover the maximum possible area without overlapping unnecessarily.

3. **Calculate the Area:**
   The area of a circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \). We need to calculate the total area of the circles and then consider the overlapping areas.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the radii of the circles
radii = [1, 3, 5, 7]

# Calculate the area of each circle
areas = [sp.pi * r**2 for r in radii]

# Calculate the total area without considering overlaps
total_area = sum(areas)

# To maximize S, we need to minimize the overlaps.
# Since all circles are tangent at point A and lie on either side of the line,
# the maximum overlap occurs when the largest circle covers the entire configuration.
# The other","Suppose that line $\ell$ is horizontal, and each circle lies either north or south to $\ell.$ We construct the circles one by one:

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to follow the transformations step-by-step and use the final position of point \( P(a, b) \) to determine its original coordinates.

1. **Rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise around (1, 5):**
   The formula for rotating a point \((x, y)\) counterclockwise by 90 degrees around another point \((h, k)\) is:
   \[
   (x', y') = (k - (y - k), h + (x - h))
   \]

2. **Reflection about the line \( y = -x \):**
   The formula for reflecting a point \((x, y)\) about the line \( y = -x \) is:
   \[
   (x', y') = (-y, -x)
   \]

Given that the final position after both transformations is \((-6, 3)\), we can work backwards to find the original coordinates \((a, b)\).

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the final point after both transformations
final_x, final_y = -6, 3

# Step 2: Reflect about the line y = -x
# Reflecting (-6, 3) about the line y = -x gives us (-3, 6)
reflected_x = -final_y
reflected_y = -final_x

# Step 1: Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise around (1, 5)
# We need to reverse the rotation to find the point before rotation
# The formula for reversing the rotation is:
# (x,","The final image of $P$ is $(-6,3)$ . We know the reflection rule for reflecting over $y=-x$ is $(x,y) \rightarrow (-y, -x)$ . So before the reflection and after rotation the point is $(-3,6)$
By definition of rotation, the slope between $(-3,6)$ and $(1,5)$ must be perpendicular to the slope between $(a,b)$ and $(1,5)$ . The first slope is $\frac{5-6}{1-(-3)} = \frac{-1}{4}$ . This means the slope of $P$ and $(1,5)$ is $4$
Rotations also preserve distance to the center of rotation, and since we only ""travelled"" up and down by the slope once to get from $(3,-6)$ to $(1,5)$ it follows we shall only use the slope once to travel from $(1,5)$ to $P$

1. **Rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise around (1, 5):**

   \[
   (x', y') = (k - (y - k), h + (x - h))

A $90^\circ$ rotation around the point $(1, 5)$ can be done by translating the point $(1, 5)$ to the origin, rotating around the origin by $90^\circ$ , and then translating the origin back to the point $(1, 5)$ \[a+b\cdot{i}  \implies (a-1)+(b-5)\cdot{i} \implies ((a-1)+(b-5)\cdot{i})\cdot{i} = 5-b+(a-1)i \implies 5+1-b+(a-1+5)i = 6-b+(a+4)i.\] By basis reflection rules, the reflection of $(-6, 3)$ about the line $y = -x$ is $(-3, 6)$ .

If we let the original point be $(x, y)$ , then we can use that the starting point is $(1,5)$ to obtain two vectors $\langle -4,1 \rangle$ and $\langle x-1, y-5 \rangle$ .
We know that two vectors are perpendicular if their dot product is equal to $0$ , and that both points are the same distance ( $\sqrt {17}$ ) from $(1,5)$
Therefore, we can write two equations using these vectors: $(x-1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 17$ (from distance and pythagorean theorem) and $-4x+y-1 = 0$ (from dot product)
Solving, we simplify the second equation to $y=4x+1$ , and plug it into the first equation.
We obtain $(x-1)^2 + (4x-4)^2 = 17$ . We can simplify this to the quadratic $17x^2-34x=0$ . 
When we factor out $17x$ , we find that $x = 2$ or $x = 0$ . However, $x$ cannot equal $0$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of volume conservation. The volume of water in the cone will be equal to the volume of water in the cylinder.

1. **Calculate the volume of water in the cone:**
   The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cone is given by:
   \[
   V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cone.

2. **Calculate the volume of water in the cylinder:**
   The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi R^2 H
   \]
   where \(R\) is the radius of the base and \(H\) is the height of the water in the cylinder.

3. **Set the volumes equal and solve for \(H\):**
   Since the volume of water is conserved, we have:
   \[
   V_{\text{cone}} = V_{\text{cylinder}}
   \]

Given:
- Radius of the cone base \(r = 12 \text{ cm}\)
- Height of the cone \(h = 18 \text{ cm}\)
- Radius of the cylinder base \(R = 24 \text{ cm}\)
- Height of the water in the cylinder \(H\) (which we need to find)

Let's calculate the height of the water in the cylinder using these steps.

First, we calculate the volume of the cone:
\[
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (12)^2 (18)
\]
","The volume of a cone is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$ where $r$ is the base radius and $h$ is the height. The water completely fills up the cone so the volume of the water is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot18\cdot144\pi = 6\cdot144\pi$
The volume of a cylinder is $\pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$ so the volume of the water in the cylinder would be $24\cdot24\cdot\pi\cdot h$
We can equate these two expressions because the water volume stays the same like this $24\cdot24\cdot\pi\cdot h = 6\cdot144\pi$ . We get $4h = 6$ and $h=\frac{6}{4}$
So the answer is $\boxed{1.5}.$"

","The water completely fills up the cone. For now, assume the radius of both cone and cylinder are the same. Then the cone has $\frac{1}{3}$ of the volume of the cylinder, and so the height is divided by $3$ . Then, from the problem statement, the radius is doubled, meaning the area of the base is quadrupled (since $2^2 = 4$ ).
Therefore, the height is divided by $3$ and divided by $4$ , which is $18 \div 3 \div 4 = \boxed{1.5}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the pan and the number of brownies that can be cut such that the number of interior pieces equals the number of perimeter pieces.

Let's denote the dimensions of the pan as \( m \times n \) brownies. We will make cuts parallel to the sides of the pan, resulting in smaller rectangular pieces.

1. **Total Number of Pieces:**
   The total number of brownies is \( m \times n \).

2. **Interior Pieces:**
   The interior pieces are those not on the edge. So, if we make cuts that divide the pan into \( k \times l \) pieces, the number of interior pieces is \((m-1) \times (n-1)\).

3. **Perimeter Pieces:**
   The perimeter pieces include the pieces along the edges. There are \(2m + 2n - 4\) pieces along the perimeter (each side minus the corners counted twice).

Given that the number of interior pieces equals the number of perimeter pieces, we have:
\[
(m-1)(n-1) = 2m + 2n - 4
\]

We need to find the maximum possible value of \( m \times n \) under this condition.

Let's solve this using Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
m, n = sp.symbols('m n', integer=True)

# Define the equation
equation = (m-1)*(n-1) - (2*m + 2*n - 4)

# Solve the equation for integer values of m and n

for m_","Let the side lengths of the rectangular pan be $m$ and $n$ . It follows that $(m-2)(n-2) = \frac{mn}{2}$ , since half of the brownie pieces are in the interior. This gives $2(m-2)(n-2) = mn \iff mn - 4m - 4n + 8 = 0$ . Adding 8 to both sides and applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick , we obtain $(m-4)(n-4) = 8$ . Since $m$ and $n$ are both positive, we obtain $(m, n) = (5, 12), (6, 8)$ (up to ordering). By inspection, $5 \cdot 12 = \boxed{60}$ maximizes the number of brownies."

eq1 = 3*n**2 + 2*n + d - 263
eq2 = 3*n**2 + 2","We can start by setting up an equation to convert $\underline{32d}$ base $n$ to base 10. To convert this to base 10, it would be $3{n}^2+2n+d.$ Because it is equal to 263, we can set this equation to 263. Finally, subtract $d$ from both sides to get $3{n}^2+2n = 263-d$
We can also set up equations to convert $\underline{324}$ base $n$ and $\underline{11d1}$ base 6 to base 10. The equation to covert $\underline{324}$ base $n$ to base 10 is $3{n}^2+2n+4.$ The equation to convert $\underline{11d1}$ base 6 to base 10 is ${6}^3+{6}^2+6d+1.$
Simplify ${6}^3+{6}^2+6d+1$ so it becomes $6d+253.$ Setting the above equations equal to each other, we have \[3{n}^2+2n+4 = 6d+253.\] Subtracting 4 from both sides gets $3{n}^2+2n = 6d+249.$
We can then use equations \[3{n}^2+2n = 263-d\] \[3{n}^2+2n = 6d+249\] to solve for $d$ . Set $263-d$ equal to $6d+249$ and solve to find that $d=2$
Plug $d=2$ back into the equation $3{n}^2+2n = 263-d$ . Subtract 261 from both sides to get your final equation of $3{n}^2+2n-261 = 0.$ We solve using the quadratic formula to find that the solutions are $9$ and $-29/3.$ Because the base must be positive, $n=9.$
Adding 2 to 9 gets $\boxed{11}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and parallel lines intersecting chords. Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the distance between the parallel lines.

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Let the circle be centered at the origin \(O\) with radius \(R\).
   - Let the three chords be created by three parallel lines \(L_1\), \(L_2\), and \(L_3\) intersecting the circle.
   - The chords are of lengths 38, 38, and 34.
   - Let the distance between \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) be \(d\), and between \(L_2\) and \(L_3\) also be \(d\).

2. **Use the Chord Length Formula:**
   The length of a chord intersecting a circle can be given by:
   \[
   L = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d^2}
   \]
   where \(L\) is the length of the chord and \(d\) is the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the chord.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - For chord of length 38:
     \[
     38 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_1^2}
     \]
   - For chord of length 38:
     \[
     38 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_2^2}
     \]
   - For chord of length 34:
     \[
     34 = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d_3^2}
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve:**

Since two parallel chords have the same length ( $38$ ), they must be equidistant from the center of the circle. Let the perpendicular distance of each chord from the center of the circle be $d$ . Thus, the distance from the center of the circle to the chord of length $34$ is
\[2d + d = 3d\]
and the distance between each of the chords is just $2d$ . Let the radius of the circle be $r$ . Drawing radii to the points where the lines intersect the circle, we create two different right triangles:
By the Pythagorean theorem, we can create the following system of equations:
\[19^2 + d^2 = r^2\]
\[17^2 + (2d + d)^2 = r^2\]
Solving, we find $d = 3$ , so $2d = \boxed{6}$"

### Solution: To solve the given problem, we need to find the value of \( x^{11} - 7x^{7} + x^3 \) given that \( x + \frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{5} \).

First, we will solve for \( x \) from the equation \( x + \frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{5} \).

\[
\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 = (\sqrt{5})^2

\[

We can factor out $x^7$ from our original expression of $x^{11}-7x^7+x^3$ to get that it is equal to $x^7(x^4-7+\frac{1}{x^4})$ .

First, we will solve for \( x \) from the equation \( x + \frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{5} \).

Let's start by squaring both sides of the equation:
\[
\left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 = (\sqrt{5})^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{x}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5
\]
\[
x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 5
\]
\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 3
\]

Next, we will multiply both sides of the equation by \( x^2 \):
\[
x^4 + 1 = 3x^2
\]
\[
x^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( x^2 \). Let \( y = x^2 \):
\[
y^2 - 3y + 1 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 1 \):
\[
y = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}","The equation we are given is $x+\tfrac{1}{x}=\sqrt{5}...$ Yuck. Fractions and radicals! We multiply both sides by $x,$ square, and re-arrange to get \[x^2+1=\sqrt{5}x \implies x^4+2x^2+1=5x^2 \implies x^4-3x^2+1=0.\] Now, let us consider the expression we wish to acquire. Factoring out $x^3,$ we have \[x^3\left(x^8-7x^4+1\right) = x^3\left(x^8+2x^4+1-9x^4\right).\] Then, we notice that $x^8+2x^4+1=\left(x^4+1\right)^2.$ Furthermore, \[x^4+1=3x^2 \implies \left(x^4+1\right)^2=x^8+2x^4+1=9x^4.\] Thus, our answer is \[x^3\left(9x^4-9x^4\right) = x^3 \cdot 0 = \boxed{0} ~ 0.\] ~peace09"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find all uphill integers that are divisible by 15. An uphill integer is defined such that each digit is strictly greater than the previous digit. 

A number is divisible by 15 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 5. For a number to be divisible by 5, it must end in 0 or 5. Since an uphill integer cannot have repeating digits and must have each digit strictly greater than the previous one, it must end in 5.

For a number to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3.

Given these constraints, we need to find all uphill integers ending in 5 whose digits sum to a multiple of 3.

Let's break down the steps:
1. Generate all combinations of digits (1-9) that form uphill integers ending in 5.
2. Check if the sum of the digits in each combination is divisible by 3.
3. Count such numbers.

We'll use Python and SymPy to implement this solution.

    num_str = str(num)
    return all(int(num_str[i]) > int(num_str[i+1]) for i in range(len(num_str) - 1))

digits = list(range(1, 10))
combinations = []

","The divisibility rule of $15$ is that the number must be congruent to $0$ mod $3$ and congruent to $0$ mod $5$ . Being divisible by $5$ means that it must end with a $5$ or a $0$ . We can rule out the case when the number ends with a $0$ immediately because the only integer that is uphill and ends with a $0$ is $0$ which is not positive. So now we know that the number ends with a $5$ . Looking at the answer choices, the answer choices are all pretty small, so we can generate all of the numbers that are uphill and are divisible by $3$ . These numbers are $15, 45, 135, 345, 1245, 12345$ , or $\boxed{6}$ numbers."

","First, note how the number must end in either $5$ or $0$ in order to satisfying being divisible by $15$ . However, the number can't end in $0$ because it's not strictly greater than the previous digits. Thus, our number must end in $5$ . We do casework on the number of digits.
Case 1: $1$ digit. No numbers work, so $0$ numbers.
Case 2: $2$ digits. We have the numbers $15, 45,$ and $75$ , but $75$ isn't an uphill number, so $2$ numbers
Case 3: $3$ digits. We have the numbers $135, 345$ , so $2$ numbers.
Case 4: $4$ digits. We have the numbers $1235, 1245$ and $2345$ , but only $1245$ satisfies this condition, so $1$ number.
Case 5: $5$ digits. We have only $12345$ , so $1$ number.

","Like solution 2, we can proceed by using casework. A number is divisible by $15$ if is divisible by $3$ and $5.$ In this case, the units digit must be $5,$ otherwise no number can be formed.

There is only one number, $15.$

","An integer is divisible by $15$ if it is divisible by $3$ and $5$ . Divisibility by $5$ means ending in $0$ or $5$ , but since no digit is less than $0$ , the only uphill integer ending in $0$ could be $0$ , which is not positive. This means the integer must end in $5$
All uphill integers ending in $5$ are formed by picking any subset of the sequence $(1,2,3,4)$ of digits (keeping their order), then appending a $5$ . Divisibility by $3$ means the sum of the digits is a multiple of $3$ , so our choice of digits must add to $0$ modulo $3$
$5 \equiv -1 \pmod{3}$ , so the other digits we pick must add to $1$ modulo $3$ . Since $(1,2,3,4) \equiv (1,-1,0,1) \pmod{3}$ , we can pick either nothing, or one residue $1$ (from $1$ or $4$ ) and one residue $-1$ (from $2$ ), and we can then optionally add a residue $0$ (from $3$ ).

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the set of cards and possible combinations:**
   Each player is given 2 cards out of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 10}. We need to find all possible pairs of cards for each player.

2. **Calculate the possible scores:**
   For each combination of cards, calculate the sum to see if it matches any of the given scores (11, 4, 7, 16, 17).

3. **Check all combinations:**
   Ensure that each player has a unique set of cards and that the total number of cards is 10.

4. **Verify the statements:**
   Check which of the given statements (A-E) are true based on the valid combinations.

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy and itertools to handle combinations.

Then, $S=x+y+z$
First, when the greatest integer is removed, $\frac{S-x}{k-1}=32$
When the smallest integer is also removed, $\frac{S-x-y}{k-2}=35$
When the greatest integer is added back, $\frac{S-y}{k-1}=40$
We are given that $x=y+72$
After you substitute $x=y+72$ , you have 3 equations with 3 unknowns $S,$ $y$ and $k$
$S-y-72=32k-32$
$S-2y-72=35k-70$
$S-y=40k-40$

### Solution: To solve this problem, let's define the set \( S \) as \( \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) where \( a_1 \) is the least integer and \( a_n \) is the greatest integer. We are given the following conditions:

1. Removing the greatest integer \( a_n \) results in an average of \( 32 \) for the remaining integers.
2. Removing both \( a_1 \) and \( a_n \) results in an average of \( 35 \) for the remaining integers.
3. Re-adding \( a_n \) results in an average of \( 40 \).
4. The greatest integer \( a_n \) is \( 72 \) greater than the least integer \( a_1 \).

Let's denote the sum of all integers in \( S \) as \( \sum S \).

From the conditions, we can set up the following equations:

1. \(\frac{\sum S - a_n}{n-1} = 32 \)
2. \(\frac{\sum S - a_n - a_1}{n-2} = 35 \)
3. \(\frac{\sum S - a_1}{n-1} = 40 \)
4. \( a_n = a_1 + 72 \)

Let's solve these equations step-by-step using",We should plug in $36.2$ and assume everything is true except the $35$ part. We then calculate that part and end up with $35.75$ . We also see with the formulas we used with the plug in that when you increase by $0.2$ the $35.75$ part decreases by $0.25$ . The answer is then $\boxed{36.8}$ . You can work backwards because it is multiple choice and you don't have to do critical thinking. ~Lopkiloinm

Let's solve these equations step-by-step using","Let $S = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, \hdots, a_n\}$ with $a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < \hdots < a_n.$ We are given the following: \[{\begin{cases} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i = 32(n-1) = 32n-32, \\ \sum_{i=2}^n a_i = 40(n-1) = 40n-40, \\ \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i = 35(n-2) = 35n-70, \\ a_n-a_1 = 72 \implies a_1 + 72 = a_n. \end{cases}}\] Subtracting the third equation from the sum of the first two, we find that \[\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \left(32n-32\right) + \left(40n-40\right) - \left(35n-70\right) = 37n - 2.\] Furthermore, from the fourth equation, we have \[\sum_{i=2}^{n} a_i - \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} a_i = \left[\left(a_1 + 72\right) + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i\right] - \left[\left(a_1\right) + \sum_{i=2}^{n-1} a_i\right] = \left(40n-40\right)-\left(32n-32\right).\] Combining like terms and simplifying, we have \[72 = 8n-8 \implies 8n = 80 \implies n=10.\] Thus, the sum of the elements in $S$ is $37 \cdot 10 - 2 = 368,$ and since there are 10 elements in $S,$ the average of the elements in $S$ is $\tfrac{368}{10}=\boxed{36.8}$"

Draw diagonals $AC$ and $AD$ to split the pentagon into three parts. We can compute the area for each triangle and sum them up at the end. For triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ , they each have area $2\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{4}=\sqrt{3}$ . For triangle $ACD$ , we can see that $AC=AD=2\sqrt{3}$ and $CD=2$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of triangle \( \triangle AEC' \) given the conditions of the folded square piece of paper.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The square has side length 1.
   - The paper is folded such that \( C'","We can set the point on $CD$ where the fold occurs as point $F$ . Then, we can set $FD$ as $x$ , and $CF$ as $1-x$ because of symmetry due to the fold. It can be recognized that this is a right triangle, and solving for $x$ , we get,
\[x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = (1-x)^2 \rightarrow x^2 + \frac{1}{9} = x^2 - 2x + 1 \rightarrow x=\frac{4}{9}\]
We know this is a 3-4-5 triangle because the side lengths are $\frac{3}{9}, \frac{4}{9}, \frac{5}{9}$ . We also know that $EAC'$ is similar to $C'DF$ because angle $EC'F$ is a right angle. Now, we can use similarity to find out that the perimeter is just the perimeter of $C'DF \times \frac{AC'}{DF}$ . That's just $\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{\frac{2}{3}}{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{4}{3} \times \frac{3}{2} = 2$ . Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{2}$"

   - The paper is folded such that \( C'","Let the line we're reflecting over be $\ell$ , and let the points where it hits $AB$ and $CD$ , be $M$ and $N$ , respectively. Notice, to reflect over a line we find the perpendicular passing through the midpoint of the two points (which are the reflected and the original). So, we first find the equation of the line $\ell$ . The segment $CC'$ has slope $\frac{0 - 1}{1 - 2/3} = -3$ , implying line $\ell$ has a slope of $\frac{1}{3}$ . Also, the midpoint of segment $CC'$ is $\left( \frac{5}{6}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$ , so line $\ell$ passes through this point. Then, we get the equation of line $\ell$ is simply $y = \frac{1}{3} x + \frac{2}{9}$ . Then, if the point where $B$ is reflected over line $\ell$ is $B'$ , then we get $BB'$ is the line $y = -3x$ . The intersection of $\ell$ and segment $BB'$ is $\left( - \frac{1}{15}, \frac{1}{5} \right)$ . So, we get $B' = \left(- \frac{2}{15}, \frac{2}{5} \right)$ . Then, line segment $B'C'$ has equation $y = \frac{3}{4} x + \frac{1}{2}$ , so the point $E$ is the $y$ -intercept, or $\left(0, \frac{1}{2} \right)$ .

Then, the perimeter is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{5}{6} = 2$ , so our answer is $\boxed{2}$ . ~rocketsri"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the perimeter of triangle \( \triangle AEC' \) given the conditions of the folded square piece of paper.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The square has side length 1.
   - The paper is folded such that \( C'","As described in Solution 1, we can find that $DF=\frac{4}{9}$ , and $C'F = \frac{5}{9}.$
Then, we can find we can find the length of $\overline{AE}$ by expressing the length of $\overline{EF}$ in two different ways, in terms of $AE$ . If let $AE = a$ , by the Pythagorean Theorem we have that $EC = \sqrt{a^2 + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{4}{9}}.$ Therefore, since we know that $\angle EC'F$ is right, by Pythagoras again we have that $EF = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{a^2+\frac{4}{9}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{9}\right)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + \frac{61}{81}}.$
Another way we can express $EF$ is by using Pythagoras on $\triangle XEF$ , where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $F$ to $\overline{AE}.$ We see that $ADFX$ is a rectangle, so we know that $AD = 1 = FX$ . Secondly, since $FD = \frac{4}{9}, EX = a - \frac{4}{9}$ . Therefore, through the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $EF = \sqrt{\left(a-\frac{4}{9}\right)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{a^2 - \frac{8}{9}a +\frac{97}{81}}.$
Since we have found two expressions for the same length, we have the equation $\sqrt{a^2 + \frac{61}{81}} = \sqrt{a^2 - \frac{8}{9}a +\frac{97}{81}}.$ Solving this, we find that $a=\frac{1}{2}$
Finally, we see that the perimeter of $\triangle AEC'$ is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{4}{9}},$ which we can simplify to be $2$ . Thus, the answer is $\boxed{2}.$ ~laffytaffy"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that at least one box receives 3 blocks all of the same color when each of the three people independently places one block into each of 5 boxes.

Let's break down the problem into manageable parts:

1. **Total Possible Arrangements:**
   Each person has 5 choices for placing their block into 5 boxes, and there are 3 people. The total number of possible arrangements is \(5^5\) for each person, and since there are 3 people, the total number of arrangements is \((5^5)^3\).

2. **Favorable Arrangements:**
   We need to count the number of favorable arrangements where at least one box receives 3 blocks of the same color. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count these arrangements.

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   - Let \(A_i\) be the event that box \(i\) gets 3 blocks of the same color.
   - We need to find \(\Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4 \cup A_5)\).
   - Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
     \[
     \Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4 \cup A_5) = \sum_{i=1}^5 \Pr(A_i) - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 5} \Pr(A_i \cap A_j) + \sum_{1 \leq i <","Let our denominator be $(5!)^3$ , so we consider all possible distributions.
We use PIE (Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion) to count the successful ones.
When we have at $1$ box with all $3$ balls the same color in that box, there are $_{5} C _{1} \cdot _{5} P _{1} \cdot (4!)^3$ ways for the distributions to occur ( $_{5} C _{1}$ for selecting one of the five boxes for a uniform color, $_{5} P _{1}$ for choosing the color for that box, $4!$ for each of the three people to place their remaining items).
However, we overcounted those distributions where two boxes had uniform color, and there are $_{5} C _{2} \cdot _{5} P _{2} \cdot (3!)^3$ ways for the distributions to occur ( $_{5} C _{2}$ for selecting two of the five boxes for a uniform color, $_{5} P _{2}$ for choosing the color for those boxes, $3!$ for each of the three people to place their remaining items).
Again, we need to re-add back in the distributions with three boxes of uniform color... and so on so forth.
Our success by PIE is \[_{5} C _{1} \cdot _{5} P _{1} \cdot (4!)^3 - _{5} C _{2} \cdot _{5} P _{2} \cdot (3!)^3 + _{5} C _{3} \cdot _{5} P _{3} \cdot (2!)^3 - _{5} C _{4} \cdot _{5} P _{4} \cdot (1!)^3 + _{5} C _{5} \cdot _{5} P _{5} \cdot (0!)^3 = 120 \cdot 2556.\] \[\frac{120 \cdot 2556}{120^3}=\frac{71}{400},\] yielding an answer of $\boxed{471}$"

Denote $T_n$ as the total number of ways to put $n$ colors to $n$ boxes by 3 people out of which $f_n$ ways are such that no box has uniform color. Notice $T_n = (n!)^3$ . From this setup we see the question is asking for $1-\frac{f_5}{(5!)^3}$ . To find $f_5$ we want to exclude the cases of a) one box of the same color, b) 2 boxes of the same color, c) 3 boxes of same color, d) 4 boxes of the same color, and e) 5 boxes of the same color. Cases d) and e) coincide. From this, we have
\[f_5=T_5 -{\binom{5}{1}\binom{5}{1}\cdot f_4 - \binom{5}{2}\binom{5}{2}\cdot 2!\cdot f_3 - \binom{5}{3}\binom{5}{3}\cdot 3!\cdot f_2 - 5!}\]
In case b), there are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose 2 boxes that have the same color, $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to choose the two colors, 2! ways to permute the 2 chosen colors, and $f_3$ ways so that the remaining 3 boxes don’t have the same color. The same goes for cases a) and c). In case e), the total number of ways to permute 5 colors is $5!$ . Now, we just need to calculate $f_2$ $f_3$ and $f_4$
We have $f_2=T_2-2 = (2!)^3 - 2 = 6$ , since we subtract the number of cases where the boxes contain uniform colors, which is 2.
In the same way, $f_3=T_3-\Big[3!+ \binom{3}{1}\binom{3}{1}\cdot f_2 \Big] = 156$ - again, we must subtract the number of ways at least 1 box has uniform color. There are $3!$ ways if 3 boxes each contains uniform color. Two boxes each contains uniform color is the same as previous. If one box has the same color, there are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to pick a box, and $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to pick a color for that box, 1! ways to permute the chosen color, and $f_2$ ways for the remaining 2 boxes to have non-uniform colors. Similarly, $f_4=(4!)^3-\Big[ 4!+ \binom{4}{2}\binom{4}{2}\cdot 2! \cdot f_2+ \binom{4}{1}\binom{4}{1}\cdot f_3\Big] = 10,872$
Thus, $f_5 = f_5=(5!)^3-\Big[\binom{5}{1}\binom{5}{1}\cdot f_4+ \binom{5}{2}\binom{5}{2}\cdot 2!\cdot f_3+\binom{5}{3}\binom{5}{3}\cdot 3!\cdot f_2 + 5!\Big] = (5!)^3 - 306,720$
Thus, the probability is $\frac{306,720}{(5!)^3} = 71/400$ and the answer is $\boxed{471}$"

$\textbf{(A)} ~47 \qquad\textbf{(B)} ~94 \qquad\textbf{(C)} ~227 \qquad\textbf{(D)} ~471 \qquad\textbf{(E)} ~542$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that at least one box receives 3 blocks all of the same color when each of the three people independently places one block into each of 5 boxes.

Let's break down the problem into manageable parts:

1. **Total Possible Arrangements:**
   Each person has 5 choices for placing their block into 5 boxes, and there are 3 people. The total number of possible arrangements is \(5^5\) for each person, and since there are 3 people, the total number of arrangements is \((5^5)^3\).

2. **Favorable Arrangements:**
   We need to count the number of favorable arrangements where at least one box receives 3 blocks of the same color. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count these arrangements.

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   - Let \(A_i\) be the event that box \(i\) gets 3 blocks of the same color.
   - We need to find \(\Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4 \cup A_5)\).
   - Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
     \[
     \Pr(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_4 \cup A_5) = \sum_{i=1}^5 \Pr(A_i) - \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 5} \Pr(A_i \cap A_j) + \sum_{1 \leq i <","$!n$ denotes the number of derangements of $n$ elements, i.e. the number of permutations where no element appears in its original position. Recall the recursive formula $!0 = 1, !1 = 0, !n = (n-1)(!(n-1)+{!}(n-2))$
We will consider the number of candidate boxes (ones that currently remain uniform-color) after each person places their blocks.
After Ang, all $5$ boxes are candidates, and each has a fixed color its blocks must be to remain uniform-color.
Ben has $5!$ total ways to place blocks. There are $\tbinom{5}{k}\cdot{!}k$ ways to disqualify $k$ candidates, $0 \le k \le 5$ . (There are $\tbinom{5}{k}$ ways to choose the candidates to disqualify, and $!k$ ways to arrange the disqualified candidates' same-color blocks.)
Jasmin has $5!$ total ways to place blocks. Currently, $k$ boxes are no longer candidates. Consider the number of ways for Jasmin to place blocks such that no box remains a candidate, where $n$ is the number of boxes and $k$ is the number of non-candidates, and call it $D(n,k)$ (not to be confused with partial derangements). We wish to find $5!-D(5,k)$ for each $k$ $0 \le k \le 5$
Notice that $D(n,0) = {!}n$ , since all boxes are candidates and no block can be placed in the same-colored box. Also notice the recursive formula $D(n,k) = D(n-1,k-1)+D(n,k-1)$ , since the first non-candidate box can either contain its same-color block (in which case it can be ignored), or a different-color block (in which case it can be treated as a candidate).
We can make a table ( $n$ horizontal, $k$ vertical): \[\begin{array}{r|rrrrrr} D(n,k) & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 9 & 44 \\ 1 & & 1 & 1 & 3 & 11 & 53 \\ 2 & & & 2 & 4 & 14 & 64 \\ 3 & & & & 6 & 18 & 78 \\ 4 & & & & & 24 & 96 \\ 5 & & & & & & 120 \\ \end{array}\] (Note that $D(n,n) = n!$ since there are no candidates to begin with, which checks out with the diagonal.)
The desired values of $D(5,k)$ are in the rightmost column.
The probability that at least one box is of uniform color is thus \begin{align*} & \frac{\sum_{k=0}^{5}{\left(\binom{5}{k}\cdot{!}k\right)(5!-D(5,k))}}{(5!)^2} \\ ={}& \frac{(1\cdot1)(120-44)+(5\cdot0)(120-53)+(10\cdot1)(120-64)+(10\cdot2)(120-78)+(5\cdot9)(120-96)+(1\cdot44)(120-120)}{(5!)^2} \\ ={}& \frac{76+0+560+840+1080+0}{(5!)^2} \\ ={}& \frac{19+140+210+270}{(5!)(5\cdot3\cdot2)} \\ ={}& \frac{639}{(5!)(5\cdot3\cdot2)} \\ ={}& \frac{71}{(5\cdot4\cdot2)(5\cdot2)} \\ ={}& \frac{71}{400} \implies \boxed{471}"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that a coin of diameter 1 will overlap with any part of the black regions on the square.

First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Calculate the total possible region for the coin's center:**
   - The coin has a diameter of 1, so its radius is \(0.5\).
   - The coin must be completely contained within the square, which has a side length of 8.
   - Therefore, the center of the coin can be anywhere within a smaller square of side length \(8 - 1 = 7\) (since the coin must be at least 0.5 units","To find the probability, we look at the $\frac{\text{success region}}{\text{total possible region}}$ . For the coin to be completely contained within the square, we must have the distance from the center of the coin to a side of the square to be at least $\frac{1}{2}$ , as it's the radius of the coin. This implies the $\text{total possible region}$ is a square with side length $8 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 7$ , with an area of $49$ . Now, we consider cases where needs to land to partially cover a black region.
Near The Center Square
We can have the center of the coin land within $\frac{1}{2}$ outside of the center square, or inside of the center square.  So, we have a region with $\frac{1}{2}$ emanating from every point on the exterior of the square, forming four quarter circles and four rectangles. The four quarter circles combine to make a full circle of radius $\frac{1}{2}$ , so the area is $\frac{\pi}{4}$ . The area of a rectangle is $2 \sqrt 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \sqrt 2$ , so $4$ of them combine to an area of $4 \sqrt 2$ . The area of the black square is simply $\left(2\sqrt 2\right)^2 = 8$ . So, for this case, we have a combined total of $8 + 4\sqrt 2 + \frac{\pi}{4}$ . Onto the second (and last) case.
Near A Triangle
We can also have the coin land within $\frac{1}{2}$ outside of one of the triangles. By symmetry, we can just find the successful region for one of them, then multiply by $4$ . Consider the above diagram. We can draw an altitude from the bottom corner of the square to hit the hypotenuse of the green triangle. The length of this when passing through the black region is $\sqrt 2$ , and when passing through the white region (while being contained in the green triangle) is $\frac{1}{2}$ . However, we have to subtract off when it doesn't pass through the red square. Then, it's the hypotenuse of a small isosceles right triangle with side lengths of $\dfrac{1}{2}$ which is $\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.$ So, the altitude of the green triangle is $\sqrt 2 + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt 2}{2} = \frac{\sqrt 2 + 1}{2}$ . Then, recall, the area of an isosceles right triangle is $h^2$ , where $h$ is the altitude from the right angle. So, squaring this, we get $\frac{3 + 2\sqrt 2}{4}$ . Now, we have to multiply this by $4$ to account for all of the black triangles, to get $3 + 2\sqrt 2$ as the final area for this case.
Finishing
Then, to have the coin touching a black region, we add up the area of our successful regions, or $8 + 4\sqrt 2 + \frac{\pi}{4} + 3 + 2\sqrt 2 = 11 + 6\sqrt 2 + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{44 + 24\sqrt 2 + \pi}{4}$ . The total region is $49$ , so our probability is $\frac{\frac{44 + 24\sqrt 2 + \pi}{4}}{49} = \frac{44 + 24\sqrt 2 + \pi}{196}$ , which implies $a+b = 44+24 = 68$ . This corresponds to answer choice $\boxed{68}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine which starting configuration guarantees a win for Beth. This involves analyzing the game states and understanding the winning and losing positions.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Game States:**
   - A game state is represented by the sizes of the walls.
   - We need to determine if a state is winning or losing.

2. **Base Case:**
   - The state \((0)\) is a losing position because the player who faces a state of zero bricks to remove is forced to lose.

3. **Recursive Case:**
   - A state \((w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n","We say that a game state is an N-position if it is winning for the next player (the player to move), and a P-position if it is winning for the other player. We are trying to find which of the given states is a P-position.
First we note that symmetrical positions are P-positions, as the second player can win by mirroring the first player's moves. It follows that $(6, 1, 1)$ is an N-position, since we can win by moving to $(2, 2, 1, 1)$ ; this rules out $\textbf{(A)}$ . We next look at $(6, 2, 1)$ . The possible next states are \[(6, 2), \enskip (6, 1, 1), \enskip (6, 1), \enskip (5, 2, 1), \enskip (4, 2, 1, 1), \enskip (4, 2, 1), \enskip (3, 2, 2, 1), \enskip (3, 2, 1, 1), \enskip (2, 2, 2, 1).\] None of these are symmetrical, so we might reasonably suspect that they are all N-positions. Indeed, it just so happens that for all of these states except $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ , we can win by moving to $(2, 2, 1, 1)$ ; it remains to check that $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ are N-positions.
To save ourselves work, it would be nice if we could find a single P-position directly reachable from both $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ . We notice that $(3, 2, 1)$ is directly reachable from both states, so it would suffice to show that $(3, 2, 1)$ is a P-position. Indeed, the possible next states are \[(3, 2), \enskip (3, 1, 1), \enskip (3, 1), \enskip (2, 2, 1), \enskip (2, 1, 1, 1), \enskip (2, 1, 1),\] which allow for the following refutations:
\begin{align*} &(3, 2) \to (2, 2), && &&(3, 1, 1) \to (1, 1, 1, 1), && &&(3, 1) \to (1, 1), \\ &(2, 2, 1) \to (2, 2), && &&(2, 1, 1, 1) \to (1, 1, 1, 1), && &&(2, 1, 1) \to (1, 1). \end{align*}
Hence, $(3, 2, 1)$ is a P-position, so $(6, 2)$ and $(6, 1)$ are both N-positions, along with all other possible next states from $(6, 2, 1)$ as noted before. Thus, $(6, 2, 1)$ is a P-position, so our answer is $\boxed{6,2,1}$ as in Solution 2.)"

   - A state \((w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n","Consider the following, much simpler game.
Arjun and Beth can each either take 1 or 2 bricks from the right-hand-side of a continuous row of initially $n$ bricks.
It is easy to see that for $n$ a multiple of 3, Beth can ""mirror"" whatever Arjun plays: if he takes 1, she takes 2, and if he takes 2, she takes 1. With this strategy, Beth always takes the last brick. If $n$ is not a multiple of 3, then Arjun takes whichever amount puts Beth in the losing position.
The total number of bricks in the initial states given by the answer choices is $8, 9, 10, 10, 11$ . Thus, answer choice $\textbf{(B)}$ appears promising as a winning position for Beth. The difference between this game and the simplified game is that in certain positions, namely those consisting of fragments of size only 1, taking 2 bricks is not allowed. We can assume that for the starting position $(6, 2, 1)$ , Beth always has a move to ensure that she can continue to mirror Arjun throughout the game. (This could be proven rigorously with lots of casework. In particular, she must avoid providing Arjun with a position of 3 continuous bricks, because then he could take the middle block and force a win.)

   - A state \((w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n","We can start by guessing and checking our solutions. Let's start with $A$ $(6,1,1)$ . Arjun goes first, and he has a winning strategy. His strategy is to cut the 6 block in half, so whatever Beth does, Arjun will copy. If we see this in practice, Arjun has made the block in to $(2,2,1,1)$ . If Beth takes 1, he will take one. If Beth takes 2, he will take 2 as well.
Then, we can guess solution $B$ $(6,2,1)$ . If Arjun starts by taking 1 of the blocks, he will either have $(6,1,1)$ $(6,2)$ $(x,y,2,1)$ (Where $x+y = 5$ ). If he has $(6,1,1)$ , Beth can take 2 out of the middle of $(6,1,1)$ to get $(2,2,1,1)$ which we know Arjun will lose because we know by symmetry from answer choice $A$ . If he has $(6,2)$ , Beth will take out one from the edge, and we get $(5,2)$ . Beth can now copy whatever Arjun does, so she will win.
Next, if he takes one out to get $(x,y,2,1)$ , we can either have $(4,1,2,1)$ or $(3,2,2,1)$ . If it is the first case, Beth can take the edge 2 out of the 4, which gives us $(2,1,2,1)$ and whatever Arjun does, Beth can do, so she has established a win. If it is the 2nd case, Beth can take out 2 from the 3 to get $(1,2,2,1)$ , in which, Beth can copy whatever Arjun does, so Beth will win. So in all 4 cases, Beth wins. So our answer is $\boxed{6,2,1}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the slope \( m \) such that exactly 300 lattice points lie on or below the line \( y = mx \) for the given set of points \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x, y \leq 30\).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The total number of lattice points in the set \( S \) is \( 30 \times 30 = 900 \).
   - We need to find the slope \( m \) such that exactly 300 points lie on or below the line \( y = mx \).

2. **Formulating the Problem:**
   - The line \( y = mx \) will pass through some lattice points. We need to count these points for different values of \( m \).

3. **Counting Points:**
   - For a given slope \( m \), count the number of points \((x, y)\) such that \( y \leq mx \).

4. **Iterating Over Possible Values of \( m \):**
   - We need to find the interval of \( m \) values where the count of points is exactly 300.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the interval of \( m \) and calculate the length of this interval.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the total number of points
total_points = 30 * 30
target_points = 300

# Define the range for x and y
x_range = range(1, 31)
y_range = range(1, ","I know that I want about $\frac{2}{3}$ of the box of integer coordinates above my line. There are a total of 30 integer coordinates in the desired range for each axis which gives a total of 900 lattice points. I estimate that the slope, m, is $\frac{2}{3}$ . Now, although there is probably an easier solution, I would try to count the number of points above the line to see if there are 600 points above the line. The line $y=\frac{2}{3}x$ separates the area inside the box so that $\frac{2}{3}$ of the are is above the line.
I find that the number of coordinates with $x=1$ above the line is 30, and the number of coordinates with $x=2$ above the line is 29. Every time the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x$ hits a y-value with an integer coordinate, the number of points above the line decreases by one. I wrote out the sum of 30 terms in hopes of finding a pattern. I graphed the first couple positive integer x-coordinates, and found that the sum of the integers above the line is $30+29+28+28+27+26+26 \ldots+ 10$ . The even integer repeats itself every third term in the sum. I found that the average of each of the terms is 20, and there are 30 of them which means that exactly 600 above the line as desired. This give a lower bound because if the slope decreases a little bit, then the points that the line goes through will be above the line.
To find the upper bound, notice that each point with an integer-valued x-coordinate is either $\frac{1}{3}$ or $\frac{2}{3}$ above the line. Since the slope through a point is the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, a shift in the slope will increase the y-value of the higher x-coordinates. We turn our attention to $x=28, 29, 30$ which the line $y=\frac{2}{3}x$ intersects at $y= \frac{56}{3}, \frac{58}{3}, 20$ . The point (30,20) is already counted below the line, and we can clearly see that if we slowly increase the slope of the line, we will hit the point (28,19) since (28, $\frac{56}{3}$ ) is closer to the lattice point. The slope of the line which goes through both the origin and (28,19) is $y=\frac{19}{28}x$ . This gives an upper bound of $m=\frac{19}{28}$
Taking the upper bound of m and subtracting the lower bound yields $\frac{19}{28}-\frac{2}{3}=\frac{1}{84}$ . This is answer $1+84=$ $\boxed{85}$"

$N = \lfloor m \rfloor+\lfloor 2m \rfloor+\lfloor 3m \rfloor+\cdots+\lfloor 30m \rfloor = 300 .$
Let $m = \frac{2}{3}+k$ . for $\forall x_{i}\le 30, x\in N^{*},  \lfloor mx_{i} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{2}{3}x+xk \rfloor.$
Our target is finding the minimum value of $k$ which can increase one unit of $\lfloor mx_{i} \rfloor .$
Notice that:
When $x_{i} = 3n, \lfloor mx_{i} \rfloor = \lfloor 2n+(3n)k \rfloor$ We don't have to discuss this case.
When $x_{i} = 3n+1, \lfloor mx_{i} \rfloor = \lfloor 2n+\frac{2}{3}+(3n+1)k \rfloor, k_{min1}=\frac{1}{3(3n+1)}.$
When $x_{i} = 3n+2, \lfloor mx_{i} \rfloor = \lfloor 2n+1+\frac{1}{3}+(3n+2)k \rfloor, k_{min2}=\frac{2}{3(3n+2)}.$
Here $n\in N^{*}, n \le 9.$
Denote $k_{min}=min\left \{k_{min1},k_{min2}  \right \}.$
Obviously $k_{min1}$ and $k_{min2}$ are decreasing. Let's considering the situation when $n=9.$
$k_{min}=min\left\{\frac{1}{84},\frac{2}{87}\right\}=\frac{1}{84}.$
This means that the answer is just $\frac{1}{84}$ , so $a+b=85$ .  Choose $\boxed{85}.$"

Those lattice points are divided by the diagonal $y = \frac{p}{q} \cdot x$ into $2$ halves. In this problem the number of lattice points on or below the diagonal and $x \ge 1$ is
$(p+1)(q+1)$ is the total number of lattice points inside the rectangle. Subtract the number of lattice points on the diagonal, divided by 2 is the number of lattice points below the diagonal, add the number of lattice points on the diagonal, and subtract the lattice points on the $x$ axis, then we get the total number of lattice points on or below the diagonal and $x \ge 1$
There are $900$ lattice points in total. $300$ is $\frac{1}{3}$ of $900$ . The $x$ coordinate of the top-right vertex of the rectangle is $30$ $\frac{1}{2} \cdot 30 \cdot 20 = 300$ . I guess the $y$ coordinate of the top-right vertex of the rectangle is $20$ . Now I am going to verify that.  The slope of the diagonal is $\frac{20}{30} = \frac{2}{3}$ , there are $11$ lattice points on the diagonal. Substitute $(p,q)=(30, 20)$ $d=11$ to the above formula:
Because there are $11$ lattice points on line $y = \frac{2}{3}x$ , if $m < \frac{2}{3}$ , then the number of lattice points on or below the line is less than $300$ . So $m = \frac{2}{3}$ is the lower bound.
Now I am going to calculate the upper bound. From $\frac{b}{a} < \frac{b+1}{a+1}$
$\frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{27} < \frac{19}{28}$

When $m$ increases, more lattice points falls below the line $y = mx$ . Any value larger than $\frac{19}{28}$ has more than $301$ lattice points on or below $y = \frac{19}{28} x$ . So the upper bound is $\frac{19}{28}$

4. **Solve for \(a + b\):**
   Subtract 15 from both sides:
   \[
   a + b = 60

5. **Find the average of \(a\) and \(b\):**
   The average of \(a\) and \(b\) is:
   \[

The simplified expression provided by SymPy is:

\[
\frac{-(a - 3)(b - 4)(c - 5)}{(3 - a)(4 - b)(5 - c)}

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the driver's net rate of pay in dollars per hour after accounting for the gasoline expenses. Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled**: The driver travels at 60 miles per hour for 2 hours.
2. **Calculate the total revenue**: The driver earns $0.50 per mile.
3. **Calculate the total gasoline cost**: The driver's car gets 30 miles per gallon, and gasoline costs $2.00 per gallon.
4. **Calculate the net earnings**: Subtract the total gasoline cost from the total revenue.
5. **Calculate the net rate of pay per hour**: Divide the net earnings by the total travel time in hours.

speed = 60  # miles per hour
time = 2  # hours
pay_per_mile = 0.50  # dollars
gas_cost_per_gallon = 2.00  # dollars
miles_per_gallon = 30  # miles per gallon

# Calculate the total distance traveled
total_distance = speed * time

# Calculate the total revenue
total_revenue = total_distance * pay_per_mile

# Calculate the total gasoline used
total_gasoline = total_distance / miles_per_gallon

# Calculate the total gasoline cost
total_gas_cost = total_gasoline * gas_cost_per_gallon

# Calculate the net earnings
net_earnings = total_revenue - total_gas_cost
","Since the driver travels $60$ miles per hour and each hour she uses $2$ gallons of gasoline, she spends $$4$ per hour on gas. If she gets $$0.50$ per mile, then she gets $$30$ per hour of driving. Subtracting the gas cost, her net rate of money earned per hour is $\boxed{26}$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 4-digit positive integers that have only even digits and are divisible by 5.

The even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

A 4-digit number is in the form \(ABCD\), where each of \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are digits from the set of even digits. However, since the number must be divisible by 5, \(D\) must be 0 or 5. But since we only have even digits, \(D\) must be 0.

Let's break down the problem:
1. \(A\) can be 2, 4, 6, or 8 (since it's a 4-digit number and cannot be 0).
2. \(B\) and \(C\) can be any of the even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

We will use Python and sympy to calculate the total number of such valid numbers.

```python

# Initialize count of valid numbers
count = 0

# A must be one of 2, 4, 6, or 8

    # B and C can be any even digit
    for B in even_digits:
        for C in even_digits:
            # D must be 0 to be divisible by 5
            D = 0
            # Form the number

There is one choice for the units digit, 5 choices for each of the middle 2 digits, and 4 choices for the thousands digit, we have a total of $4\cdot5\cdot5\cdot1 = \boxed{100} \qquad$ numbers."

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to arrange the 25 integers from -10 to 14 in a 5x5 square matrix such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal are all the same. This requires the matrix to be a magic square.

The sum of all integers from -10 to 14 can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Sum} = \sum_{i=-10}^{14} i
\]

Since the matrix is 5x5 and contains 25 numbers, the common sum for each row, column, and diagonal can be denoted as \( S \). Therefore, the total sum of the matrix should be:

(3k - 1) + (3k) + (3k + 1) - (3k + 2) = 3k - 1 + 3k + 1 - 3k - 2 = 3k - 2
\]

So, each pair sums to \(3k - 2\).

Now, let's calculate the sum of all such pairs from \(k","We can split the sum into 4 groups so that the terms in these groups have the same common difference of 4 $(1+5+9+...+197)+(2+6+10+...+198)+(3+7+11+...+199)-(4+8+12+...+200)$ .
Then, we can use the sum formula. It's equal to $\frac{50\cdot(1+197)}{2} + \frac{50\cdot(2+198)}{2} + \frac{50\cdot(3+199)}{2} - \frac{50\cdot(4+200)}{2}$ .
This can also be expressed as $(25\cdot198) + (25\cdot200) + (25\cdot202) - (25\cdot204)$ .
And it is equal to $25\cdot(198+200+202-204) = 25\cdot396 = 9900$ .
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{9900}$ . ~kurbanlik_21"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that an equal number of adults and children can fill up \( N \) bench sections completely.

Given:
- 1 bench section can hold 7 adults or 11 children.
- An equal number of adults and children fill up \( N \) bench sections.

Let's denote:
- Number of adults = \( A \)
- Number of children = \( C \)
- Number of bench sections = \( N \)

Since the number of adults and children are equal, we have \( A = C \).

The total seating capacity for adults and children in \( N \) bench sections are:
- Total adults = \( 7A \times N \)
- Total children = \( 11C \times N \)

Since \( A = C \), we can write:
\[ 7A \times N = 11A \times N \]

This implies that \( N \) must be such that the total seating for adults equals the total seating for children.

Let's solve this using Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
A, C, N = sp.symbols('A C N')

# Given A = C
A = C

# Total seating in N bench sections
total_adults = 7 * A * N
total_children = 11 * C * N

# Equation for equal seating

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking the cubes. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Determine the side lengths of the cubes:**
   The volumes of the cubes are given as \(1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216,\) and \(343\) cubic units. The side lengths of these cubes are the cube roots of these volumes, which are \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\) and \(7\) units respectively.

2. **Calculate the surface area of each cube:**
   The surface area \(A\) of a cube with side length \(s\) is given by \(6s^2\).

3. **Calculate the total surface area:**
   Since the bottom face of each cube (except the bottom cube) is completely on top of the cube below it, the visible faces of each cube will be the top faces and part of the side faces.

4. **Adjust for overlapping faces:**
   Each cube except the bottom one has its bottom face (which is \(s^2\)) hidden by the cube below it. Therefore, we need to subtract the bottom face area of each cube except the bottom one.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy:

```python

# Function","The volume of each cube follows the pattern of $n^3$ , for $n$ is between $1$ and $7$
We see that the total surface area can be comprised of three parts: the sides of the cubes, the tops of the cubes, and the bottom of the $7\times 7\times 7$ cube (which is just $7 \times 7 = 49$ ). The sides areas can be measured as the sum $4\sum_{n=1}^{7} n^2$ , giving us $560$ . Structurally, if we examine the tower from the top, we see that it really just forms a $7\times 7$ square of area $49$ . Therefore, we can say that the total surface area is $560 + 49 + 49 = \boxed{658}$ .
Alternatively, for the area of the tops, we could have found the sum $\sum_{n=2}^{7}((n)^{2}-(n-1)^{2})$ , giving us $49$ as well."

Then, we need to subtract out the overlapped parts of the cubes. Between each consecutive pair of cubes, one of the smaller cube's faces is completely covered, along with an equal area of one of the larger cube's faces. The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$ .

Since $44^2$ is $44 + 45 = 89$ less than $45^2 = 2025$ and $84$ less than $2020$ , we will only need to consider the perfect square terms going down from the $2064$ th term, $2020$ , after going down $84$ terms. Since the $2020$ th and $2021$ st terms are only $44$ and $43$ terms away from the $2064$ th term, we can simply subtract $44$ from $2020$ and $43$ from $2020$ to get the two terms, which are $1976$ and $1977$ . Averaging the two, we get $\boxed{1976.5}.$"

### Solution: To find the median of the list of 4040 numbers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the List Structure**:
   The list consists of two parts:
   - The first part is an arithmetic sequence from 1 to 2020.
   - The second part is the squares of the numbers from 1 to 2020.

2. **Combine and Sort the List**:
   Combine both parts and sort the list to find the median.

3. **Find the Median**:
   Since the list has 4040 elements (an even number), the median will be the average of the 2020th and 2021st elements in the sorted list.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Generate the first part of the list: 1, 2, ..., 2020
first_part = list(range(1, 2021))

# Generate the second part of the list: 1^2, 2^2, ..., 2020^2
second_part = [i**2 for i in range(1, 2021)]

# Combine both parts
full_list = first_part + second_part

# Sort the combined list
full_list.sort()

# Find the median
median = (full_list[2019] + full_list[2020]) / 2

print(median)

The median of the list of","We want to know the $2020$ th term and the $2021$ st term to get the median.
We know that $44^2=1936$ . So, numbers $1^2, 2^2, \ldots,44^2$ are in between $1$ and $1936$
So, the sum of $44$ and $1936$ will result in $1980$ , which means that $1936$ is the $1980$ th number.
Also, notice that $45^2=2025$ , which is larger than $2021$
Then the $2020$ th term will be $1936+40 = 1976$ , and similarly the $2021$ th term will be $1977$
Solving for the median of the two numbers, we get $\boxed{1976.5}$"

We note that every term before $2020$ is one less than the previous term (That is, we subtract $1$ to get the previous term.). If $2020$ is the $2064$ th term, than $2020 - 44$ is the $(2064 - 44)$ th term.

If $\triangle AUV$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ the area of $\triangle AMC$ , then trapezoid $MUVC$ is $\frac{3}{4}$ the area of $\triangle AMC$

Area of $\triangle MUV = \frac{x\cdot12}{2}=6x$
Area of $\triangle MCV = \frac{(12-x)\cdot12}{2}=72-6x$

Let $AB$ be the height. Since medians divide each other into a $2:1$ ratio, and the medians have length 12, we have $PC=MP=8$ and $UP=VP=4$ . From right triangle $\triangle{MUP}$ \[MU^2=MP^2+UP^2=8^2+4^2=80,\] so $MU=\sqrt{80}=4\sqrt{5}$ . Since $CU$ is a median, $AM=8\sqrt{5}$ . From right triangle $\triangle{MPC}$ \[MC^2=MP^2+PC^2=8^2+8^2=128,\] which implies $MC=\sqrt{128}=8\sqrt{2}$ . By symmetry $MB=\dfrac{8\sqrt{2}}{2}=4\sqrt{2}$
Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to right triangle $\triangle{MAB}$ gives $AB^2=AM^2-MB^2=8\sqrt{5}^2-4\sqrt{2}^2=288$ , so $AB=\sqrt{288}=12\sqrt{2}$ . Then the area of $\triangle{AMC}$ is \[\dfrac{AB \cdot MC}{2}=\dfrac{8\sqrt{2} \cdot 12\sqrt{2}}{2}=\dfrac{96 \cdot 2}{2}=\boxed{96}\]"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the frog's sequence of jumps ends on a vertical side of the square. The vertical sides of the square are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 4\).

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Let's define \(P(x, y)\) as the probability that the frog, starting at \((x, y)\), will reach the vertical side \(x = 0\) or \(x = 4\).

The recursive relationship for \(P(x, y)\) is:
\[ P(x, y) = \frac{1}{4} P(x-1, y) + \frac{1}{4} P(x+1, y) + \frac{1}{4} P(x, y-1) + \frac{1}{4} P(x, y+1) \]

The boundary conditions are:
- \(P(0, y) = 1\) for all \(y\), because if \(x = 0\), the frog definitely reaches the vertical side \(x = 0\).
- \(P(4, y) = 1\) for all \(y\), because if \(x = 4\), the frog definitely reaches the vertical side \(x = 4\).
- \(P(x, 0) = 0\) for all \(x\), because if \(y = 0\), the frog is not on a vertical side.
- \(P(x, 4) = 0\) for all","Drawing out the square, it's easy to see that if the frog goes to the left, it will immediately hit a vertical end of the square. Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{4}$ . If the frog goes to the right, it will be in the center of the square at $(2,2)$ , and by symmetry (since the frog is equidistant from all sides of the square), the chance it will hit a vertical side of a square is $\frac{1}{2}$ . The probability of this happening is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
If the frog goes either up or down, it will hit a line of symmetry along the corner it is closest to and furthest to, and again, is equidistant relating to the two closer sides and also equidistant relating the two further sides. The probability for it to hit a vertical wall is $\frac{1}{2}$ . Because there's a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of the frog going up or down, the total probability for this case is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$ and summing up all the cases, $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{8}       \implies \boxed{58}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that the frog's sequence of jumps ends on a vertical side of the square. The vertical sides of the square are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 4\).

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. Let's define \(P(x, y)\) as the probability that the frog, starting at \((x, y)\), will reach the vertical side \(x = 0\) or \(x = 4\).

The recursive relationship for \(P(x, y)\) is:
\[ P(x, y) = \frac{1}{4} P(x-1, y) + \frac{1}{4} P(x+1, y) + \frac{1}{4} P(x, y-1) + \frac{1}{4} P(x, y+1) \]

The boundary conditions are:
- \(P(0, y) = 1\) for all \(y\), because if \(x = 0\), the frog definitely reaches the vertical side \(x = 0\).
- \(P(4, y) = 1\) for all \(y\), because if \(x = 4\), the frog definitely reaches the vertical side \(x = 4\).
- \(P(x, 0) = 0\) for all \(x\), because if \(y = 0\), the frog is not on a vertical side.
- \(P(x, 4) = 0\) for all","If the frog is on one of the 2 diagonals, the chance of landing on vertical or horizontal each becomes $\frac{1}{2}$ . Since it starts on $(1,2)$ , there is a $\frac{3}{4}$ chance (up, down, or right) it will reach a diagonal on the first jump and $\frac{1}{4}$ chance (left) it will reach the vertical side. The probablity of landing on a vertical is $\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\boxed{58}$ .

Now we create equations for the probabilities at each of these points/states by considering the probability of going either up, down, left, or right from that point: \[P_{(1,2)}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,1)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,2)}\] \[P_{(2,2)}=\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{2}P_{(2,1)}\] \[P_{(1,1)}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,1)}\] \[P_{(2,1)}=\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,1)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,2)}\] We have a system of $4$ equations in $4$ variables, so we can solve for each of these probabilities. Plugging the second equation into the fourth equation gives \[P_{(2,1)}=\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,1)}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{2}P_{(2,1)}\right)\] \[P_{(2,1)}=\frac{8}{7}\left(\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,1)}+\frac{1}{8}P_{(1,2)}\right)=\frac{4}{7}P_{(1,1)}+\frac{1}{7}P_{(1,2)}\] Plugging in the third equation into this gives \[P_{(2,1)}=\frac{4}{7}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,1)}\right)+\frac{1}{7}P_{(1,2)}\] \[P_{(2,1)}=\frac{7}{6}\left(\frac{1}{7}+\frac{2}{7}P_{(1,2)}\right)=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{3}P_{(1,2)}\text{    (*)}\] Next, plugging in the second and third equation into the first equation yields \[P_{(1,2)}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,1)}\right)+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{2}P_{(2,1)}\right)\] \[P_{(1,2)}=\frac{3}{8}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(2,1)}\] Now plugging in (*) into this, we get \[P_{(1,2)}=\frac{3}{8}+\frac{1}{4}P_{(1,2)}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{3}P_{(1,2)}\right)\] \[P_{(1,2)}=\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{5}{12}=\boxed{58}\] -mathisawesome2169"

First, we note the different places the frog can go at certain locations in the square:
If the frog is at a border vertical point ( $(1,2),(3,2)$ ), it moves with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a vertical side of the square, probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to the center of the square, and probability $\frac{1}{2}$ to a corner square.
If the frog is at a border horizontal point ( $(2,1),(2,3)$ ), it moves with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a horizontal side of the square, probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to the center of the square, and probability $\frac{1}{2}$ to a corner square.
If the frog is at a center square ( $(2,2)$ ), it moves with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ to a border horizontal point and probability $\frac{1}{2}$ to a border vertical point.
If the frog is at a corner ( $(1,1),(1,3),(3,3),(3,1)$ ), it moves with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a vertical side of the square, probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a horizontal side, probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a border horizontal point, and probability $\frac{1}{4}$ to a border vertical point.
Now, let $x$ denote the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side when it is at a border vertical point. Similarly, let $y$ denote the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side when it is at a border horizontal point.
Now, the probability of the frog reaching a vertical side of the square at any location inside the square can be expressed in terms of $x$ and $y$
First, the two easier ones: $P_{center}=\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y$ , and $P_{corner}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{1}{4}y$ .
Now, we can write $x$ and $y$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ , allowing us to solve a system of two variables: \[x=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}P_{center}+\frac{1}{2}P_{corner}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{1}{4}y\right)\] and \[y=\frac{1}{4}P_{center}+\frac{1}{2}P_{corner}=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{1}{4}y\right).\] From these two equations, it is apparent that $y=x-\frac{1}{4}$ . We can then substitute this value for $y$ back into any of the two equations above to get \[x=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{1}{4}\right)\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}x+\frac{1}{4}\left(x-\frac{1}{4}\right)\right).\] Although this certainly looks intimidating, we can expand the parentheses and multiply both sides by 16 to eliminate the fractions, which upon simplification yields the equation \[16x=5+8x,\] giving us the desired probability $x=\frac{5}{8}$ . The answer is then $\boxed{58}$"

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   We are given:
   \[
   x + y = 4
   \]

We first change the original expression to $4 + \frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2 y^2}$ , because $x + y = 4$ . This is equal to $4 + \frac{(x + y)(x^4 - x^3 y + x^2 y^2 - x y^3 + y^4)}{4} = x^4 + y^4 - x^3 y - x y^3 + 8$ . We can factor and reduce $x^4 + y^4$ to $(x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2 x^2 y^2 = ((x + y)^2 - 2xy)^2 - 8 = 400 - 8 = 392$ . Now our expression is just $400 - (x^3 y + x y^3)$ . We factor $x^3 y + x y^3$ to get $(xy)(x^2 + y^2) = -40$ . So the answer would be $400 - (-40)  = \boxed{440}$"

eq2 = x * y +","We first simplify the expression to \[x + y + \frac{x^5 + y^5}{x^2y^2}.\] Then, we can solve for $x$ and $y$ given the system of equations in the problem.
Since $xy = -2,$ we can substitute $\frac{-2}{x}$ for $y$ . 
Thus, this becomes the equation \[x - \frac{2}{x} = 4.\] Multiplying both sides by $x$ , we obtain $x^2 - 2 = 4x,$ or \[x^2 - 4x - 2 = 0.\] By the quadratic formula we obtain $x = 2 \pm \sqrt{6}$ . 
We also easily find that given $x = 2 \pm \sqrt{6}$ $y$ equals the conjugate of $x$ . 
Thus, plugging our values in for $x$ and $y$ , our expression equals \[4 + \frac{(2 - \sqrt{6})^5 + (2 + \sqrt{6})^5}{(2 - \sqrt{6})^2(2 + \sqrt{6})^2}\] By the binomial theorem, we observe that every second terms of the expansions $x^5$ and $y^5$ will cancel out (since a positive plus a negative of the same absolute value equals zero). We also observe that the other terms not canceling out are doubled when summing the expansions of $x^5 + y^5$ .
Thus, our expression equals \[4 + \frac{2(2^5 + \tbinom{5}{2}2^3 \times 6 + \tbinom{5}{4}2 \times 36)}{(2 - \sqrt{6})^2(2 + \sqrt{6})^2}.\] which equals \[4 + \frac{2(872)}{4}\] which equals $\boxed{440}$"

Start by squaring $x + y$ , to obtain \[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 16\] Simplifying, $x^2 + y^2 = 20$ . Squaring once more, we obtain \[x^4 + y^4 + 2x^2y^2 = 400\] Once again simplifying, $x^4 + y^4 = 392$ .

We start by noticing that we can rewrite the equation as $\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \frac{y^3}{x^2} + x + y.$ Then, we know that $x + y = 4,$ so we have $\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \frac{y^3}{x^2} + 4.$ We can use the equation $x \cdot y = -2$ to write $x = \frac{-2}{y}$ and $y = \frac{-2}{x}.$ Next, we can plug in these values of $x$ and $y$ to get $\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \frac{y^3}{x^2} = \frac{x^5}{4} + \frac{y^5}{4},$ which is the same as \[\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \frac{y^3}{x^2} = \frac{x^5 + y^5}{4}.\] Then, we use Newton sums where $S_n$ is the elementary symmetric sum of the sequence and $P_n$ is the power sum ( $x^n + y^n$ ). Using this, we can make the following Newton sums: \[P_1 = S_1\] \[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2\] \[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2\] \[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2\] \[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2.\] We also know that $S_1$ is 4 because $x + y$ is four, and we know that $S_2$ is $-2$ because $x \cdot y$ is $-2$ as well.
Then, we can plug in values! We have \[P_1 = S_1 = 4\] \[P_2 = P_1 S_1 - 2S_2 = 16 - (-4) = 20\] \[P_3 = P_2 S_1 - P_1 S_2 = 80 - (-8) = 88\] \[P_4 = P_3 S_1 - P_2 S_2 = 88 \cdot 4 - (-40) = 392\] \[P_5 = P_4 S_1 - P_3 S_2 = 392 \cdot 4 - (-2) \cdot 88 = 1744.\] We earlier noted that $\frac{x^3}{y^2} + \frac{y^3}{x^2} = \frac{x^5 + y^5}{4},$ so we have that this equals $\frac{1744}{4},$ or $436.$ Then, plugging this back into the original equation, this is $436 + 4$ or $440,$ so our answer is $\boxed{440}.$"

Then, since the numerators are the same, we can put the two fractions as a common denominator and multiply the numerator by $x^2y^2.$ This gets us $\frac{(x^2 + y^2)(x^3 + y^3)}{x^2y^2}.$
Now, since we know $x+y=4$ and $xy=-2,$ instead of solving for $x$ and $y,$ we will try to manipulate the above expression them into a manner that we can substitute the sum and product that we know. Also, another form of $x^3+y^3$ is $(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2).$
Thus, we can convert the current expression to $\frac{(x^2 + y^2)(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}{x^2y^2}.$
Doing some algebraic multiplications, we get $\frac{((x+y)^2 - 2xy)(x+y)((x+y)^2 - 3xy)}{(xy)^2}.$

We can find $x^2y^2 = (xy)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$ and we can find $x^3y^2 + x^2y^3 = x^2y^2(x + y) = 16$ . Our expression $\frac{xy^2 + x^5 + y^5 + x^2y}{x^2y^2}$ is now $\frac{16 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$ .

Thus $(x + y)^5 = x^5 + y^5 - 720 = 1024$ so $x^5 + y^5 = 1024 + 720 = 1744$ . Remember our goal: we want to find $\frac{-8 + x^5 + y^5}{4}$ .

Now to get the final answer, all we need to do is to plug it back into the original equation and get $\frac{1744}{4} + 4 = \boxed{440}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen divisor of \(12!\) is a perfect square. This probability can be expressed as \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers, and we need to find \(m + n\).

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Prime Factorization of \(12!\)**:
   Determine the prime factorization of \(12!\).

2. **Divisors of \(12!\)**:
   Express any divisor of \(12!\) in terms of its prime factors.

3. **Perfect Square Divisors**:
   Identify the conditions under which a divisor is a perfect square.

4. **Count Divisors and Probability**:
   Calculate the total number of divisors and the number of perfect square divisors.

5. **Simplify Probability Fraction**:
   Simplify the fraction representing the probability and find \(m + n\).

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Prime factorization of 12!
factorial_12 = sp.factorial(12)
prime_factors = sp.factorint(factorial_12)

# Step 2: Express the total number of divisors
def count_divisors(factors):
    count = 1
    for exponent in factors.values():
        count *= (exponent + 1)
    return count

# Step 3: Identify perfect square divisors
def count_perfect_square_divisors(factors):
    count = 1
    for exponent in factors.values():
        count *= (exponent // 2 + 1)
    return count

","The prime factorization of $12!$ is $2^{10} \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$ . 
This yields a total of $11 \cdot 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$ divisors of $12!.$ In order to produce a perfect square divisor, there must be an even exponent for each number in the prime factorization. Note that the divisor can't have any factors of $7$ and $11$ in the prime factorization because there is only one of each in $12!.$ Thus, there are $6 \cdot 3 \cdot 2$ perfect squares. (For $2$ , you can have $0$ $2$ $4$ $6$ $8$ , or $10$ $2$ s, etc.)
The probability that the divisor chosen is a perfect square is \[\frac{6\cdot 3\cdot 2}{11\cdot 6\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 2}=\frac{1}{22} \implies \frac{m}{n}=\frac{1}{22} \implies m\ +\ n = 1\ +\ 22 = \boxed{23}\]"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the distance \( d \) such that the probability that a point randomly chosen within the given square is within \( d \) units of a lattice point is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The square has vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((2020, 0)\), \((2020, 2020)\), and \((0, 2020)\).
   - We need to find the distance \( d \) such that the probability that a point is within \( d \) units of a lattice point is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

2. **Set Up the Problem:**
   - The area of the square is \( 2020 \times 2020 \).
   - The area within \( d \) units of a lattice point will form circles around each lattice point.

3. **Calculate the Area within \( d \):**
   - Each lattice point affects an area in the form of a circle with radius \( d \).
   - We need to find the total area covered by these circles such that it equals half the area of the square.

4. **Formulate the Equation:**
   - The area of the square is \( 2020 \times 2020 \).
   - Half of this area is \( \frac{202","[asy] size(10cm); draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle); filldraw((arc((0,0), 0.3989, 0, 90))--(0,0)--cycle, gray); draw(arc((1,0), 0.3989, 90, 180)); filldraw((arc((1,0), 0.3989, 90, 180))--(1,0)--cycle, gray); draw(arc((1,1), 0.3989, 180, 270)); filldraw((arc((1,1), 0.3989, 180, 270))--(1,1)--cycle, gray); draw(arc((0,1), 0.3989, 270, 360)); filldraw(arc((0,1), 0.3989, 270, 360)--(0,1)--cycle, gray); [/asy]
The diagram represents each unit square of the given $2020 \times 2020$ square.
We consider an individual one-by-one block.
If we draw a quarter of a circle from each corner (where the lattice points are located), each with radius $d$ , the area covered by the circles should be $0.5$ . Because of this, and the fact that there are four circles, we write
\[4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi d^2 = \frac{1}{2}\]
Solving for $d$ , we obtain $d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$ , where with $\pi \approx 3$ , we get $d \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \approx \dfrac{1}{2.5} = \dfrac{10}{25} = \dfrac{2}{5}$ , and from here, we see that $d \approx 0.4 \implies \boxed{0.4}.$"

1. The integers \( n \) such that \( P(n) = 0 \). This happens exactly at \( n = k^2 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 100 \).
2. The integers \( n \) such that \( P(n) < 0 \). This happens when the number of negative factors is odd.

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many integers \( n \) satisfy the inequality \( P(n) \leq 0 \), where \( P(x) = (x - 1^2)(x - 2^2) \cdots (x - 100^2) \).

First, let's understand the function \( P(x) \):
\[ P(x) = \prod_{k=1}^{100} (x - k^2) \]

The product \( P(x) \) will be less than or equal to zero (\( P(n) \leq 0 \)) if and only if the number of negative factors in the product is odd. This means we need to count the values of \( x = n \) for which \( P(n) \) changes sign, which typically happens at the roots of the polynomial.

The roots of \( P(x) \) are the squares of the integers from 1 to 100: \( 1^2, 2^2, \ldots, 100^2 \).

To determine how many integers \( n \) make \( P(n) \leq 0 \), we need to count:
1. The integers \( n \) such that \( P(n) = 0 \). This happens exactly at \( n = k^2 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 100 \).
2. The integers \( n \) such that \( P(n) < 0 \). This happens when the number of negative factors is odd.

Since \( P(x) \) has roots at \( x = 1^2, 2^2, \ldots, 100^2 \), we can analyze the sign of \( P(","We know that $P(x)$ is a $100$ -degree function with a positive leading coefficient. That is, $P(x)=x^{100}+ax^{99}+bx^{98}+...+\text{(constant)}$
Since the degree of $P(x)$ is even, its end behaviors match. And since the leading coefficient is positive, we know that both ends approach $\infty$ as $x$ goes in either direction, from which \[\lim_{x\to-\infty} P(x)=\lim_{x\to\infty} P(x)=\infty.\] So the first time $P(x)$ is going to be negative is when it intersects the $x$ -axis at an $x$ -intercept and it's going to dip below. This happens at $1^2$ , which is the smallest intercept.
However, when it hits the next intercept, it's going to go back up again into positive territory, we know this happens at $2^2$ . And when it hits $3^2$ , it's going to dip back into negative territory. Clearly, this is going to continue to snake around the intercepts until $100^2$
To get the amount of integers below and/or on the $x$ -axis, we simply need to count the integers. For example, the amount of integers in between the $[1^2,2^2]$ interval we got earlier, we subtract and add one. $(2^2-1^2+1)=4$ integers, so there are four integers in this interval that produce a negative result.
Doing this with all of the other intervals, we have \[(2^2-1^2+1)+(4^2-3^2+1)+\cdots+(100^2-99^2+1)=\boxed{5100}\] from Solution 2's result."

For example, to make the first factor positive, $x \in [1^2, 2^2]$ . then there will be a even number of positive factors. We would do $2^2 - 1^2 + 1 (inclusive)$ to find all integers that work. In short we can generalize too: \begin{align*} x^2 - (x-1)^2 + 1 &= 2x \\ x^2 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) + 1 &= 2x \\ x^2 - x^2 + 2x - 1 + 1 &= 2x. \\ \end{align*} But remember this only works when $x \in \{2, 4, 6, 8 \cdots 98, 100\}$ because only then will there be a odd amount of positive and negative factors. So we can set $x = 2k$ , for $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots 49, 50\}$ Now we only have to solve: \[\sum_{k=1}^{k=50}2(2k) = 2\sum_{k = 1}^{k = 50}2k = 4\sum_{k = 1}^{k = 50}k = 4 \cdot \dfrac{(50)(51)}{2} = 2 \cdot (50)(51) = \boxed{5100}.\] ~Wiselion"

We can split the caseworks into the amount of moves we spend on each row (top and bottom, where both rows have 5 faces).
Case 1: 1 move on the top row;
There are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row from the starting point (just moving on each of the five faces). Now we want to look at how many ways we can move towards the bottom. Notice how we have two faces on the bottom row that are adjacent to each of the top faces. If we spend one move on the bottom, there are 2 ways. If we spend two moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways (since order matters, we can flip the direction of these moves). If we spend three moves on the bottom, there are also 4 ways (similar reasoning). If we spend four moves on the bottom, there are 4 ways. And if we spend five moves on the bottom, there are again, 4 ways. In total there are $2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18$ ways to move from the bottom after the top moves are chosen. And since there are 5 ways to make 1 move on the top row, there are $5 \cdot 18 = 90$ ways.
Case 2: 2 moves on the top row;
From just counting, we can see that there are five ways to move once on the top, and after that, two options for the second move (either left or right), so there are $5 \cdot 2 = 10$ ways. And from using what we obtained in Case 1, there are $10 \cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case.
Case 3: three moves on the top row;
There are, again, 10 ways to do this. And so, there are $10 \cdot 18 = 180$ ways for this case to happen.
Now, we can see that there will be 10 ways for the remaining cases of the first move for the top row (because 5 ways to choose the first, and then you can go either left or right, so $5 \cdot 2 = 10$ ).
So for Case 4 and Case 5, there will both also be $10 \cdot 18 = 180$ ways.
Finally, adding all these cases up, we obtain $90 + 180 + 180 + 180 + 180 = 810$ , or $\boxed{810}$ ~Misclicked"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) given the conditions:

1. \(\angle ABC = \angle ACD = 90^\circ\)
2. \(AC = 20\)
3. \(CD = 30\)
4. \(AE = 5\)

Let's break down the problem into manageable parts and use Python and SymPy to solve it.

### Steps:

1. **Identify the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):**
   - Place \(A\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Place \(C\) at \((20, 0)\) since \(AC = 20\).
   - Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), \(B\) is at \((0, b)\) for some \(b\).
   - Since \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\), \(D\) is at \((x, y)\) such that \(CD = 30\).

2. **Use the given lengths and coordinates to find \(E\):**
   - \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - Given \(AE = 5\), \(E\) is at \((5, 0)\) since \(AC\) is a horizontal line.

3. **Find the coordinates of \(D\):**
   - Use the distance formula to find the coordinates of \(D\).

It's crucial to draw a good diagram for this one. Since $AC=20$ and $CD=30$ , we get $[ACD]=300$ . Now we need to find $[ABC]$ to get the area of the whole quadrilateral. Drop an altitude from $B$ to $AC$ and call the point of intersection $F$ . Let $FE=x$ . Since $AE=5$ , then $AF=5-x$
By dropping this altitude, we can also see two similar triangles, $\triangle BFE \sim \triangle DCE$ . Since $EC$ is $20-5=15$ , and $DC=30$ , we get that $BF=2x$
Now, if we redraw another diagram just of $ABC$ , we get that $(2x)^2=(5-x)(15+x)$ because of the altitude geometric mean theorem which states that in any right triangle, the altitude squared is equal to the product of the two lengths that it divides the base into.
Expanding, simplifying, and dividing by the GCF, we get $x^2+2x-15=0$ . This factors to $(x+5)(x-3)$ , which has roots of $x=-5, 3$ . Since lengths cannot be negative, $x=3$ . Since $x=3$ , that means the altitude $BF=2\cdot3=6$ , or $[ABC]=60$ . Thus $[ABCD]=[ACD]+[ABC]=300+60=\boxed{360}$"

We can make this a vector problem. $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ 2x+30 \end{pmatrix}.$ We notice that point $B$ forms a right angle, meaning vectors $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BC}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BA}}$ are orthogonal, and their dot-product is $0$
We determine $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BC}}$ and $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BA}}$ to be $\begin{pmatrix} -x \\ -2x-30 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} -20-x \\ -2x-30 \end{pmatrix}$ , respectively. (To get this, we use the fact that $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BC}} = \overrightarrow{\mathbf{C}}-\overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}$ and similarly, $\overrightarrow{\mathbf{BA}} = \overrightarrow{\mathbf{A}} - \overrightarrow{\mathbf{B}}.$
Equating the cross-product to $0$ gets us the quadratic $-x(-20-x)+(-2x-30)(-2x-30)=0.$ The solutions are $x=-18, -10.$ Since $B$ clearly has a more negative x-coordinate than $E$ , we take $x=-18$ . So $B = (-18, -6).$
From here, there are multiple ways to get the area of $\Delta{ABC}$ to be $60$ , and since the area of $\Delta{ACD}$ is $300$ , we get our final answer to be \[60 + 300 = \boxed{360}.\]"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) given the conditions:

1. \(\angle ABC = \angle ACD = 90^\circ\)
2. \(AC = 20\)
3. \(CD = 30\)
4. \(AE = 5\)

Let's break down the problem into manageable parts and use Python and SymPy to solve it.

### Steps:

1. **Identify the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\):**
   - Place \(A\) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Place \(C\) at \((20, 0)\) since \(AC = 20\).
   - Since \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\), \(B\) is at \((0, b)\) for some \(b\).
   - Since \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\), \(D\) is at \((x, y)\) such that \(CD = 30\).

2. **Use the given lengths and coordinates to find \(E\):**
   - \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - Given \(AE = 5\), \(E\) is at \((5, 0)\) since \(AC\) is a horizontal line.

3. **Find the coordinates of \(D\):**

Let $F$ be the midpoint of $AC$ , and draw $FG // CD$ where $G$ is on $BD$ . We have $EF=5,FC=10$
$\Delta EFG \sim \Delta ECD \implies FG=10=FA=FC$ . Therefore $ABCG$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.
Notice that $\angle EFG=90^\circ, EG=\sqrt{5^2+10^2}=5\sqrt{5} \implies BE=\frac{AE\cdot EC}{EG}=\frac{5\cdot 15}{5\sqrt{5}}=3\sqrt{5}$ via Power of a Point.
The altitude from $B$ to $AC$ is then equal to $GF\cdot \frac{BE}{GE}=10\cdot \frac{3\sqrt 5}{5 \sqrt 5}=6$
Finally, the total area of $ABCD$ is equal to $\frac 12 \cdot 20 \left(30+6 \right) =\boxed{360}.$"

Because $\triangle CEF \sim \triangle CAB$ $EF = AB \cdot \frac{CE}{CA} = x \cdot \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3x}{4}$
$BF = BC - CF = BC - BC \cdot \frac{CE}{CA} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot BC = \frac{y}{4}$
$BE = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{3x}{4} \right) ^2 + \left( \frac{y}{4} \right) ^2 } = \frac{ \sqrt{9x^2 + y^2} }{4}$ , substituting $x^2 + y^2 = 400$ ,  we get $BE = \frac{ \sqrt{8x^2 + 400} }{4} = \frac{ \sqrt{2x^2 + 100} }{2}$
$[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot x \cdot y$

$[ABC] = [ACD] \cdot \frac{BE}{DE} = 300 \cdot \frac{ \frac{ \sqrt{2x^2 + 100} } {2} }{ 15 \sqrt{5} }$

$xy = 4 \sqrt{10x^2 + 500}$
By $x^2 + y^2 = 400$ $y = \sqrt{400 - x^2}$ . So, $x \cdot  \sqrt{400 - x^2} = 4 \sqrt{10x^2 + 500}$
$x^2 (400 - x^2) = 16 (10x^2 + 500)$

Because $x < 20$ $a$ can only equal 40. $a = 40$ $x = 2 \sqrt{10}$ $y = 6 \sqrt{10}$
$[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 \sqrt{10} \cdot 6 \sqrt{10} = 60$

Therefore, we have
\[x/EF=CE/AE=15/5=3,\]
where $EG=x.$ Therefore, $EF=x/3.$
Additionally, angle chasing shows that triangles $CEG$ and $DCG$ are also similar. This gives $CG/x=DC/CE=30/15=2,$ so $CG=2x.$ Thus, applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $CEG$ gives
\[x^2+(2x)^2=15^2,\]
so $EG=x=3\sqrt 5.$ Our pairs of similar triangles then allow us to fill in the following lengths (in this order):
\[EF=x/3=\sqrt 5, CG=2x=6\sqrt 5, AF=CG/3=2\sqrt 5, DG=2\cdot CG=12\sqrt 5.\]
Now, let $BF=y.$ Angle chasing shows that triangle $ABF$ and $BCG$ are similar, so $BG/AF=CG/BF.$ Plugging in known lengths gives
\[\dfrac{y+4\sqrt 5}{2\sqrt 5}=\dfrac{6\sqrt 5}{y}.\]
This gives $y=2\sqrt 5.$ Now we know all the lengths that make up $BD,$ which allows us to find
\[BD=2\sqrt 5+\sqrt 5+3\sqrt 5+12\sqrt 5=18\sqrt 5.\]
Therefore,
\begin{align*} [ABCD] &= [ABD]+[CBD] \\ &= (BD)(AF)/2+(BD)(CG)/2 \\ &= (18\sqrt 5)(2\sqrt 5)/2+(18\sqrt 5)(6\sqrt 5)/2 \\ &= \boxed{360}"

Then, the given equation becomes $\frac{x^{17}+1}{x+1}=x^{16}-x^{15}+x^{14}...-x^1+x^0$ by sum of powers factorization.
Now consider only $x^{16}-x^{15}$ . This equals $x^{15}(x-1)=x^{15} \cdot (2^{17}-1)$ .
Note that $2^{17}-1$ equals $2^{16}+2^{15}+...+1$ , by difference of powers factorization (or by considering the expansion of $2^{17}=2^{16}+2^{15}+...+2+2$ ).
Thus, we can see that $x^{16}-x^{15}$ forms the sum of 17 different powers of 2. 
Applying the same method to each of $x^{14}-x^{13}$ $x^{12}-x^{11}$ , ... , $x^{2}-x^{1}$ , we can see that each of the pairs forms the sum of 17 different powers of 2. This gives us $17 \cdot 8=136$ .

Notice that $a_1 = 0$ , since there is a $1$ on the LHS. However, now we have an extra term of $2^{18}$ on the right from $2^{a_1+17}$ . To cancel it, we let $a_2 = 18$ . The two $2^{18}$ 's now combine into a term of $2^{19}$ , so we let $a_3 = 19$ . And so on, until we get to $a_{18} = 34$ . Now everything we don't want telescopes into $2^{35}$ . We already have that term since we let $a_2 = 18 \implies a_2+17 = 35$ . Everything from now on will automatically telescope to $2^{52}$ . So we let $a_{19}$ be $52$

We only need to add $a_n$ 's between odd multiples of $17$ and even multiples. The largest even multiple of $17$ below $289$ is $17\cdot16$ , so we will have to add a total of $17\cdot 8$ $a_n$ 's.

\]

Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the given fraction as a sum of powers of 2.

2. **Simplify the Problem:**
   Notice that \( \frac{2^{289}+1}{2^{17}+1} \) can be simplified by recognizing that \( 2^{289} + 1 \) and \( 2^{17} + 1 \) are both numbers consisting of a '1' followed by many zeros in their binary form.

3. **Use Binary Representation:**
   The division of such numbers can be understood through their binary representations. The division of \( 2^{289} + 1 \) by \( 2^{17} + 1 \) can be seen as repeated subtraction of the divisor from the dividend until the result is zero.

4. **Count the Subtractions:**
   Each subtraction in the binary long division corresponds to a power of 2 in the resulting sum.

1. **Understand the Floor Function:**
   The floor function \( \left\lfloor \frac{k}{n} \right\rfloor \) gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( \frac{k}{n} \).

4. **Iterate Over Possible Values of \( n \):**
   We will iterate over all \( n \) from 1 to 1000 and count how many make \( S(n) \mod","Clearly, $n=1$ fails. Except for the special case of $n=1$ \[\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor\] equals either $0$ or $1$ . If it equals $0$ , this implies that $\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor$ , so their sum is clearly a multiple of $3$ , so this will always fail. If it equals $1$ , the sum of the three floor terms is $3 \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor \pm 1$ , so it is never a multiple of $3$ . Thus, we are looking for all $n \neq 1$ such that \[\left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor = 1.\] This implies that either \[\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor,\] or \[\left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor.\]
Let's analyze the first equation of these two. This equation is equivalent to the statement that there is a positive integer $a$ such that \[\frac{998}{n} < a \leq \frac{999}{n} \implies 998 < an \leq 999 \implies an = 999 \implies a = \frac{999}{n} \implies n | 999.*\] Analogously, the second equation implies that \[n | 1000.\] So our only $n$ that satisfy this condition are $n \neq 1$ that divide $999$ or $1000$ . Using the method to find the number of divisors of a number, we see that $999$ has $8$ divisors and $1000$ has $16$ divisors. Their only common factor is $1$ , so there are $8+16-1 = 23$ positive integers that divide either $999$ or $1000$ . Since the integer $1$ is a special case and does not count, we must subtract this from our $23$ , so our final answer is $23-1 = \boxed{22}.$"

$\textbf{Lemma}$ : For $N, n \in \mathbb{N}$ $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor + 1$ if $n \mid N$ ; and $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor$ if $n \nmid N.$
$\textbf{Proof}$ : Let $A = kn + r$ , with $0 \leq r < n$ . If $n \mid N$ , then $r = 0$ . Hence $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = k$ $\left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{(k-1)n+n-1}{n} \right\rfloor = k-1 + \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{n} \right\rfloor = k-1$ , and $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor + 1.$
If $n \nmid N$ , then $1 \leq r < n$ . Hence $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = k$ $\left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor = k + \left\lfloor \frac{r-1}{n} \right\rfloor = k$ , and $\left\lfloor \frac{N}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{N-1}{n} \right\rfloor.$
From the lemma and the given equation, we have four possible cases: \[\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor - 1 \qquad (1)\] \[\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor \qquad (2)\] \[\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor + 1 = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor \qquad (3)\] \[\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor \qquad (4)\]
Note that cases (2) and (3) are the cases in which the term, $\left\lfloor \frac{998}{n} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{999}{n} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{n} \right\rfloor,$ is not divisible by $3$ . So we only need to count the number of $n$ 's for which cases (2) and (3) stand.
Case (2): By the lemma, we have $n \mid 1000$ and $n \nmid 999.$ Hence $n$ can be any factor of $1000$ except for $n = 1$ . Since $1000 = 2^3 * 5^3,$ there are $(3+1)(3+1) - 1 = 15$ possible values of $n$ for this case.
Case (3): By the lemma, we have $n \mid 999$ and $n \nmid 998.$ Hence $n$ can be any factor of $999$ except for $n = 1$ . Since $999 = 3^3 * 37^1,$ there are $(3+1)(1+1) - 1 = 7$ possible values of $n$ for this case.
So in total, we have total of $15+7=\boxed{22}$ possible $n$ 's."

$\textbf{Explanation:}$
Let's assume that the above expression does indeed lie betweent two consecutive multiples of $n$ . This implies that $n$ does not divide either $998, 999$ or $1000$ , meaning that when divided by $n$ , none of the quotients are whole. In turn, this also means that they will all have the same whole number part.
If $\frac{998}{n}, \frac{999}{n},$ and $\frac{1000}{n}$ were to have a different whole number part, then $n$ would have to lie within $998$ and $1000$ . If this is confusing, think of why $\frac{6}{5}, \frac{7}{5}$ and $\frac{8}{5}$ have the same whole number part ( $1$ in this case). Here, $n=5$ . What happens to the whole number part when $n=7$
Since $\frac{998}{n}, \frac{999}{n},$ and $\frac{1000}{n}$ have identical whole number parts, their floors are identical, since the floor of a number is equal to its whole number part, discarding its fractional component.
Let $k$ be the number we get when we floor $\frac{998}{n}, \frac{999}{n},$ or $\frac{1000}{n}$ if the three of those numbers lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$ . Adding them up, we get $3k$ (due to their floors being the same), which is a mulutiple of $3$ . So no matter what, we cannot have $\frac{998}{n}, \frac{999}{n},$ and $\frac{1000}{n}$ lie between two consecutive multiples of $n$
What does this mean? It means that there must be some multiple of $n$ within this expression (with some restrictions, as we'll see), in order to prevent the violation of the main restriction. We can proceed with casework now.
$\textbf{Case 1}$
Let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\frac{998}{n}$ . Luckily, the only prime factors of $998$ are $2$ and $499$
We can observe that $499$ doesn't work, since $\frac{998}{499}$ and $\frac{1000}{499}$ will both round down to $2$ when divided by it. However, $2$ does work, since it divides both $998$ and $1000$ . The floor of $\frac{999}{2}$ is $499$ , , meaning that when we evaluate the given expression for $n=2$ , we will get $2\cdot{499}+500$ which isn't a multiple of $3$
This case works because we have a multiple of $n$ at the end of the expression, as well as the beginning, so the whole number parts of $998, 999$ and $1000$ when divided by $n$ are not all the same, due to $n$ dividing two of these numbers.
The restriction of $n$ dividing more than one number within the expression is only valid when we're testing the first number in the given expression (otherwise, the other floors wouldn't round down to the same value as the first).
Case $1$ is complete, and we've found that only $2$ works.
$\textbf{Case 2}$
Now, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\frac{999}{n}$ . In this case, if $n$ divides $999$ , it doesn't divide $998$ (since two multiples of a number greater than $1$ are never consecutive), nor does it divide $1000$ , for the same reason.
The prime factorization of $999$ is $3^3\cdot37$ , and thus has $(3+1)(1+1)=8$ divisors.
When testing a few values of $n$ initially, we observed that $n=1$ causes the expression to be divisible by $3$ . Subtracting $1$ , we see that there are $7$ values of $n$ that work for this case.
$\textbf{Case 3}$
Finally, let's assume that the multiple of $n$ is located at $\frac{1000}{n}.$
Our goal is to have the other multiple of $n$ below whatever $\frac{998}{n}$ is, so we won't have identical floors throughout the expression.
Once again, any factor of $1000$ , except for $2$ is relatively prime to both $998$ and $999$ , so when we floor those two numbers, we get an integer that isn't $500$
$1000$ factors as $2^3\cdot{5^3}$ , meaning that it has $(3+1)(3+1)=16$ divisors. $1$ and $2$ either don't work or have already been counted, so there are $14$ valid values of $n$ for this case.
$\textbf{Ending}$
Adding these three cases, we get $1+7+14= \boxed{22}$ values of $n$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sequences of three transformations will return the triangle \(T\) to its original position. The transformations we are considering are:
1. Rotation of \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin.
2. Rotation of \(180^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin.
3. Rotation of \(270^\circ\) counterclockwise around the origin.
4. Reflection across the \(x\)-axis.
5. Reflection across the \(y\)-axis.

We need to consider all possible sequences of three transformations and check if they return the triangle to its original position.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:
1. Define the original triangle \(T\) and the transformations.
2. Apply each transformation to the triangle.
3. Check if the transformed triangle is the same as the original triangle.
4. Count the number of sequences that return the triangle to its original position.

We will use Python and SymPy to automate this process.

```python
import sympy as sp
from itertools import","[asy] size(10cm); Label f;  f.p=fontsize(6);  xaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  yaxis(-6,6,Ticks(f, 2.0));  filldraw(origin--(4,0)--(0,3)--cycle, gray, black+linewidth(1)); [/asy]
First, any combination of motions we can make must reflect $T$ an even number of times. This is because every time we reflect $T$ , it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$ $0$ times or $2$ times.
Case 1: $0$ reflections on $T$
In this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\{90^\circ,180^\circ,270^\circ\}$ , contains every multiple of $90^\circ$ except for $0^\circ$ . We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\{90^\circ,180^\circ,270^\circ\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \equiv -a - b \pmod{360^\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \equiv 0^\circ \pmod{360^\circ}$ . That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\circ$ , then $c \equiv -90^\circ - 90^\circ = -180^\circ \pmod{360^\circ}$ , so $c = 180^\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\circ,90^\circ,180^\circ)$ yields a full rotation.
The only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\circ$ . This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\circ,270^\circ),(180^\circ,180^\circ),$ or $(270^\circ,90^\circ)$ . However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\{90^\circ,180^\circ,270^\circ\}$ yields $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$
Case 2: $2$ reflections on $T$
In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$ 's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis.
Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2.
Combining both cases we get $6+6=\boxed{12}$"

```python
import sympy as sp
from itertools import","As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation.
Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\circ}$ as $1$ $180^{\circ}$ as $2$ , and $270^{\circ}$ as $3$ , just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ $0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$ ). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$ . This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways.
Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$ , which is $180^{\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways.

Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total.
For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$ , else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$ , which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$ . A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$ ). This gives $6$ ways.
Thus the answer is $\boxed{12}$"

Notice that if $\alpha =54$ then the condition $\gcd(\alpha,3)=1$ is violated. The next possible value of $\alpha = 94$ satisfies the given condition, giving us $n=1917$
Alternatively, we could have said $\alpha = 40k+14 \equiv{0} \pmod{3}$ for $k \equiv{1} \pmod{3}$ only, so $k \equiv{0,2} \pmod{3}$ , giving us our answer. Since the problem asks for the sum of the digits of $n$ , our answer is $1+9+1+7=\boxed{18}$"

\gcd(63, n+120) = 21
\]
\[
\gcd(n+63, 120) = 60
\]

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Conditions:**
   - \(\gcd(63, n+120) = 21\) implies that \( n+120 \) must be a multiple of 21, but not of 63.
   - \(\gcd(n+63, 120) = 60\) implies that \( n+63 \) must be a multiple of 60, but not of 120.

2. **Express the Conditions Mathematically:**
   - Let \( n + 120 = 21k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( n = 21k - 120 \).
   - Let \( n + 63 = 60m \) for some integer \( m \). Then \( n = 60m - 63 \).

3. **Equate the Two Expressions for \( n \):**
   \[
   21k - 120 = 60m - 63
   \]
   Simplify to find a relationship between \( k \) and \( m \):
   \[
   21k - 60m = 57
   \]

4. **Solve for \( k \) and \( m \):**
   We need to find","$\gcd(n+63,120)=60$ tells us $n+63\equiv60\pmod {120}$ . The smallest $n+63$ that satisfies the previous condition and $n>1000$ is $1140$ , so we start from there. If $n+63=1140$ , then $n+120=1197$ . Because $\gcd(n+120,63)=21$ $n+120\equiv21\pmod {63}$ or $n+120\equiv42\pmod {63}$ . We see that $1197\equiv0\pmod {63}$ , which does not fulfill the requirement for $n+120$ , so we continue by keep on adding $120$ to $1197$ , in order to also fulfill the requirement for $n+63$ . Soon, we see that $n+120\pmod {63}$ decreases by $6$ every time we add $120$ , so we can quickly see that $n=1917$ because at that point $n+120\equiv21\pmod {63}$ . We add up all digits of $1917$ to get $\boxed{18}$"

4. **Solve for \( k \) and \( m \):**
   We need to find","First, we find $n$ . We know that it is greater than $1000$ , so we first input $n = 1000$ . From the first equation, $\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$ , we know that if $n$ is correct, after we add $120$ to it, it should be divisible by $21$ , but not $63$ \[\frac{n + 120}{21} = \frac{1120}{21} = 53\text{ R }7.\] This does not work. To get to the nearest number divisible by $21$ , we have to add $14$ to cancel out the remainder. (Note that we don't subtract $7$ to get to $53$ $n$ is already at its lowest possible value!)
Adding $14$ to $1000$ gives us $n = 1014$ . (Note: $n$ is currently divisible by 63, but that's fine since we'll be changing it in the next step.)
Now using the second equation, $\gcd(n + 63, 120) = 60$ , we know that if $n$ is correct, then $n+63$ is divisible by $60$ but not $120$ \[\frac{n + 63}{60} = \frac{1077}{60} = 17\text{ R }57.\] Again, this does not work. This requires some guessing and checking. We can add $21$ over and over again until $n$ is valid. This changes $n$ while also maintaining that $\frac{n + 120}{21}$ has no remainders. 
After adding $21$ once, we get $18 r 18$ . By pure luck, adding $21$ two more times gives us $19$ with no remainders. 
We now have $1077 + 21 + 21 + 21 = 1140$ . However, this number is divisible by $120$ . To get the next possible number, we add the LCM of $21$ and $60$ (once again, to maintain divisibility), which is $420$ . Unfortunately, $1140 + 420 = 1560$ is still divisible by $120$ . Adding $420$ again gives us $1980$ , which is valid. However, remember that this is equal to $n + 63$ , so subtracting $63$ from $1980$ gives us $1917$ , which is $n$
The sum of its digits are $1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = \boxed{18}$"

   - \(\gcd(63, n+120) = 21\) implies that \( n+120 \) must be a multiple of 21, but not of 63.
   - \(\gcd(n+63, 120) = 60\) implies that \( n+63 \) must be a multiple of 60, but not of 120.

2. **Express the Conditions Mathematically:**
   - Let \( n + 120 = 21k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( n = 21k - 120 \).
   - Let \( n + 63 = 60m \) for some integer \( m \). Then \( n = 60m - 63 \).

3. **Equate the Two Expressions for \( n \):**
   \[
   21k - 120 = 60m - 63
   \]
   Simplify to find a relationship between \( k \) and \( m \):
   \[
   21k - 60m = 57
   \]

4. **Solve for \( k \) and \( m \):**
   We need to find","From $\gcd(63, n + 120) = 21$ , we know that \begin{align} n + 120 &\equiv 0 \pmod{7} \Rightarrow n \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \tag{1} \\ n + 120 &\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \Rightarrow n \equiv 0, 3, 6 \pmod{9} \notag \end{align} Since \begin{align} n + 120 &\not\equiv 0 \pmod{9} \Rightarrow n \not\equiv 6 \pmod{9} \notag \end{align} We must have \begin{align} n &\equiv 0 \pmod{9} \tag{2} \end{align} Or \begin{align} n &\equiv 3 \pmod{9} \tag{3} \end{align} (Note that $n + 120 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$ is impossible since then $9 | \gcd(63, n+120)$ .)
From $\gcd(n+63, 120) = 60$ , we have \begin{align} n + 63 &\equiv 0 \pmod{15} \Rightarrow n \equiv 12 \pmod {15} \tag{4} \\ n + 63 &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \Rightarrow n \equiv 1 \pmod {4} \Rightarrow n \equiv 1, 5 \pmod{8} \notag \end{align} Since \begin{align} n + 63 &\not\equiv 0 \pmod{8} \Rightarrow n \not\equiv 1 \pmod{8} \notag \end{align} We must have \begin{align} n &\equiv 5 \pmod {8} \tag{5} \end{align} Solving equations $(1)$ $(4)$ , and $(5)$ , we get \begin{align} n &\equiv 237 \pmod{840} \tag{6} \end{align} Solving $(6)$ with $(2)$ , we have \begin{align} n &\equiv 1917 \pmod{2520} \tag{7} \end{align} Solving $(6)$ with $(3)$ , we have \begin{align} n &\equiv 237 \pmod{2520} \tag{8} \end{align} From $(7)$ , we obtain $1917$ , and from $(8)$ , we obtain $237 + 2520 = 2757$ as the smallest solutions above $1000$ . Thus, we get $1 + 9 + 1 + 7 = \boxed{18}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the least possible value of \( b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are prime numbers and are the acute angles of a right triangle. The sum of the angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\), and in a right triangle, one of the angles is \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of the other two angles must be \(90^\circ\).

Given that \(a\) and \(b\) are the acute angles, we have:
\[ a + b = 90^\circ \]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are both prime numbers and \(a > b\), we need to find the smallest possible value of \(b\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check for prime numbers and find the smallest possible value of \(b\).

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding the number of distinguishable arrangements of 1 brown tile, 1 purple tile, 2 green tiles, and 3 yellow tiles, we can use the concept of permutations of a multiset.

The formula for the number of distinguishable permutations of a multiset is given by:
\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

- Frequencies of each color:
  - Brown: 1
  - Purple: 1
  - Green: 2
  - Yellow: 3

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the next palindrome after 15951 and then calculate the difference in miles traveled during the 2-hour period. Finally, we will compute Megan's average speed in miles per hour.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. We'll start by identifying the next palindrome after 15951.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Find the next palindrome:**
   - We need to find the smallest number greater than 15951 that is a palindrome.

2. **Calculate the difference in miles:**
   - Subtract the initial odometer reading from the next palindrome to get the number of miles traveled.

3. **Calculate the average speed:**
   - Divide the miles traveled by the time (2 hours) to get the average speed in miles per hour.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the next palindrome and calculate the average speed.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Function to check if a number is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(num):
    return str(num) == str(num)[::-1]

# Initial odometer reading

If we were to raise any of the digits after the middle, we would be forced to also raise a digit before the middle to keep it a palindrome, making it unnecessarily larger.
So we raise $9$ to the next largest value, $10$ , but obviously, that's not how place value works, so we're in the $16000$ s now. To keep this a palindrome, our number is now $16061$

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding how many positive even multiples of \(3\) less than \(2020\) are perfect squares, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the range of numbers to consider.
2. Determine the conditions for a number to be an even multiple of \(3\) and a perfect square.
3. Iterate through the numbers to check these conditions.

Let's break it down:

1. **Identify the range:** We are looking for numbers less than \(2020\).

2. **Conditions:**
   - The number must be an even multiple of \(3\), which means it must be divisible by both \(2\) and \(3\).
   - The number must be a perfect square.

3. **Iterate and Check:**
   - Iterate through numbers less than \(2020\).
   - Check if the number is divisible by \(6\) (since it must be even and a multiple of \(3\)).
   - Check if the number is a perfect square.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check for perfect squares.

```python
import sympy as sp

def is_perfect_square(n):
    return sp.is_square(n)

count = 0
for i in range(1, 2020):

    if i % 6 == 0 and is_perfect_square(i):
  File ""
    return sp.is_square(n)

$\textbf{(A)}\ 2 \qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 4 \qquad\textbf{(C)}\  6 \qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 8 \qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 12$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the number of locations for point \( R \) such that the triangle \( PQR \) is a right triangle with area 12 square units and \( PQ = 8 \).

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Right Triangle Condition:**
   Since \( PQR \) is a right triangle, \( R \) must lie on the perpendicular bisector of \( PQ \). Let's place \( P \) and \( Q \) on a coordinate plane with \( P = (0, 0) \) and \( Q = (8, 0) \).

2. **Area Condition:**
   The area of a right triangle is given by \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). Here, \( PQ \) is the base, which is 8 units. Therefore, the height \( h \) from \( R \) to the line \( PQ \) must satisfy:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times h = 12 \implies 4h = 12 \implies h = 3
   \]

3. **Right Triangle Locations:**
   Since the area condition gives two possible heights (3 above and 3 below the x-axis), we need to find the coordinates of \( R \) such that \( R \) is 3 units away from the x-axis.

4. **Finding Coordinates of \( R \):**
   We need to find points \( R = (x, 3) \) or \( R = (x, -3) \) that form right triangles with \( P \) and \( Q \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the number of such locations for \( R \).

```python

   The equation \(x^{2020} + (y-1)^2 = 1\) implies that \(x^{2020}\) must be either 0 or 1 because \((y-1)^2\) is always non-negative and must be less than or equal to 1.

3. **Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):**
   - If \(x^{2020} = 0\), then \(x = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \((y-1)^2 = 1\), so \(y-1 = \pm 1\), which means \(y = 0\) or \(y = 2\).
   - If \(x^{2020} = 1\), then \(x = 1\) or \(x = -1\). For both cases, \((y-1)^2 = 0\), so \(y = 1\).

The only integers that satisfy this are $x \in \{-1,0,1\}$ . Plugging these values back into the quadratic equation, we see that $x = \{-1,1\}$ both produce a discriminant of $0$ , meaning that there is only 1 solution for $y$ . If $x = \{0\}$ , then the discriminant is nonzero, therefore resulting in two solutions for $y$

"How many ordered pairs of integers $(x, y)$ satisfy the equation \[x^{2020}+y^2=2y?\]

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 2 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 3 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 4 \qquad\textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}$
### Solution: To solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation \(x^{2020} + y^2 = 2y\), we can break it down into manageable steps and use Python with SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   \[
   x^{2020} + y^2 = 2y \implies x^{2020} + y^2 - 2y = 0
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   x^{2020} + (y-1)^2 - 1 = 0 \implies x^{2020} + (y-1)^2 = 1
   \]

2. **Analyze the Equation:**
   The equation \(x^{2020} + (y-1)^2 = 1\) implies that \(x^{2020}\) must be either 0 or 1 because \((y-1)^2\) is always non-negative and must be less than or equal to 1.

3. **Solve for \(x\) and \(y\):**
   - If \(x^{2020} = 0\), then \(x = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation gives \((y-1)^2 = 1\), so \(y-1 = \pm 1\), which means \(y = 0\) or \(y = 2\).
   - If \(x^{2020} = 1\), then \(x = 1\) or \(x = -1\). For both cases, \((y-1)^2 = 0\), so \(y = 1\).

4. **Count the Ordered Pairs:**
   We have the pairs:
   - \((0, 0)\)
   - \((0,","Since $x^{2020}$ and $y^2$ are perfect squares, they are both nonnegative. That means $y^2$ plus a nonnegative number equals $2y$ , which means $y^2 \leq 2y.$ The only possible integer values for $y$ are $0, 1, 2$
For $y=0$ $x$ can only be $0$
For $y=1$ $x^2=1$ so $x=1, -1$
For $y=2$ $x$ can only be $0$ as well.
This gives us the solutions $(0, 0)$ $(1, 1)$ $(-1, 1)$ , and $(0, 2)$ . These are the only solutions, so there is a total of $\boxed{4}$ ordered pairs."

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding how many zeros are in the initial string after the decimal point for \(\dfrac{1}{20^{20}}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \(20^{20}\) in terms of powers of 10**:
   \[
   20 = 2^2 \times 5
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   20^{20} = (2^2 \times 5)^{20} = 2^{40} \times 5^{20}
   \]

2. **Calculate \(\dfrac{1}{20^{20}}\)**:
   \[
   \dfrac{1}{20^{20}} = \dfrac{1}{2^{40} \times 5^{20}}
   \]

3. **Determine the decimal representation**:
   To find how many zeros follow the decimal point, we need to consider how many places the number can shift when divided by powers of 10.

4. **Count the number of decimal places**:
   The number of decimal places is determined by the higher of the powers of 2 and 5 in the denominator. Since \(2^{40}\) and \(5^{20}\) are both larger than \(10^{20}\), we need to consider how many places we shift the decimal point to express the fraction in decimal form.

5. **Calculate the number of zeros**:
   The number of zeros after the decimal point will be the difference between the higher power and the lower power between \(2^{40}\) and \(5^{20}\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to verify the result:

```python
import sym","We have
\[\dfrac{1}{20^{20}} = \dfrac{1}{(10\cdot2)^{20}}=\dfrac{1}{10^{20}\cdot2^{20}}\]
Now we do some estimation. Notice that $2^{20} = 1024^2$ , which means that $2^{20}$ is a little more than $1000^2=1,000,000$ . Multiplying it with $10^{20}$ , we get that the denominator is about $1\underbrace{00\dots0}_{26 \text{ zeros}}$ . Notice that when we divide $1$ by an $n$ digit number as long as n is not a power of 10, there are $n-1$ zeros before the first nonzero digit. This means that when we divide $1$ by the $27$ digit integer $1\underbrace{00\dots0}_{26 \text{ zeros}}$ , there are $\boxed{26}$ zeros in the initial string after the decimal point. -PCChess"

As shown below, the digits erased in the first, second, and third rounds are colored in red, yellow, and green, respectively: [asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(20cm);  for (real i=2.5; i<30; i+=3) {    fill((i-0.5,0)--(i-0.5,4)--(i+0.5,4)--(i+0.5,0)--cycle,red); }  for (real i=4.5; i<30; i+=6) {    fill((i-0.5,0)--(i-0.5,4)--(i+0.5,4)--(i+0.5,0)--cycle,yellow); }  fill((7,0)--(7,4)--(8,4)--(8,0)--cycle,green); fill((18,0)--(18,4)--(19,4)--(19,0)--cycle,green); fill((27,0)--(27,4)--(28,4)--(28,0)--cycle,green);  for (real i=1; i<5; ++i) {    for (real j=0; j<30; ++j) {       label(""$""+string(1+j%5)+""$"",(j+0.5,i-0.5));    } }  for (real i=0; i<30; ++i) {    label(""$\vdots$"",(i+0.5,-1/3)); }  add(grid(30,4,linewidth(1.25))); [/asy] As indicated by the white squares, each group of $30$ digits on the original list has $\frac25\cdot30=12$ digits remaining on the final list.
Since $2019,2020,2021$ are congruent to $3,4,5$ modulo $12,$ respectively, the three digits in the final positions $2019,2020,2021$ are $4,2,5,$ respectively: [asy] /* Made by MRENTHUSIASM */ size(20cm);  for (real i=2.5; i<30; i+=3) {    fill((i-0.5,0)--(i-0.5,1)--(i+0.5,1)--(i+0.5,0)--cycle,red); }  for (real i=4.5; i<30; i+=6) {    fill((i-0.5,0)--(i-0.5,1)--(i+0.5,1)--(i+0.5,0)--cycle,yellow); }  fill((7,0)--(7,1)--(8,1)--(8,0)--cycle,green); fill((18,0)--(18,1)--(19,1)--(19,0)--cycle,green); fill((27,0)--(27,1)--(28,1)--(28,0)--cycle,green);  for (real j=0; j<30; ++j) {    label(""$""+string(1+j%5)+""$"",(j+0.5,0.5)); }  draw((3.5,-1.25)--(3.5,-0.2),linewidth(1.25),EndArrow); draw((6.5,-1.25)--(6.5,-0.2),linewidth(1.25),EndArrow); draw((9.5,-1.25)--(9.5,-0.2),linewidth(1.25),EndArrow);  add(grid(30,1,linewidth(1.25))); [/asy] Therefore, the answer is $4+2+5=\boxed{11}.$"

Then we have \[b_{(k-1)m+1}=a_{km+1}, b_{(k-1)m+2}=a_{km+2}, \cdots, b_{(k-1)m+k-1}=a_{km+k-1}.\]
Proof:  For $a_{km+j}$ with some $j, 1\le j\le k-1$ , we will have $m$ items removed before this item, so it becomes $b_{(k-1)m+j}$ in the new sequence. Hence, we have $b_{(k-1)m+j}=a_{km+j}$
If we start with $a_1, a_2, a_3, \cdots,$ and let $b_1, b_2, \cdots$ be the sequence after removing all the indexes that are multiples of $3$ . Then, we have $b_{2n+1}=a_{3n+1},b_{2n+2}=a_{3n+2}$
Similarly, if we start with $b_1, b_2, b_3, \cdots,$ and remove all multiples of $4$ , and get $c_1, c_2, \cdots$ We have $c_{3n+1}=b_{4n+1},c_{3n+2}=b_{4n+2},  c_{3n+3}=b_{4n+3}$
If we start with $c_1, c_2, \cdots$ and $d_1, d_2, \cdots$ are remove all multiples of $5$ , we get \[d_{4n+1}=c_{5n+1}, d_{4n+2}=c_{5n+2}, d_{4n+3}=c_{5n+3}, d_{4n+4}=c_{5n+4}.\] Therefore, \begin{align*} d_{2019}&=d_{4\cdot504+3}=c_{5\cdot 504+3}=c_{2523}=c_{3\cdot 840+3}=b_{4\cdot 840+3}=b_{3363}=b_{2\cdot 1681+1}=a_{3\cdot 1681+1}=a_{5044}=a_4=4, \\ d_{2020}&=d_{4\cdot504+4}=c_{5\cdot 504+4}=c_{2524}=c_{3\cdot841+1}=b_{4\cdot841+1}=b_{3365}=b_{2\cdot1682+1}=a_{3\cdot 1682+1}=a_{5047}=a_2=2, \\ d_{2021}&=d_{4\cdot505+1}=c_{5\cdot505+1}=c_{2526}=c_{3\cdot841+3}=b_{4\cdot841+3}=b_{3367}=b_{2\cdot1683+1}=a_{3\cdot1683+1}=a_{5050}=a_5=5, \end{align*} and the answer is $4+2+5=\boxed{11}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationships among the 10 people standing in a circle. Each person knows 3 out of the other 9 people: the two adjacent people and the one directly across the circle.

We need to determine how many ways these 10 people can be paired up such that each pair consists of people who know each other.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Each person knows the two adjacent people.
   - Each person knows the person directly across the circle.

2. **Formulate the Problem:**
   - We have 10 people: \( P_0, P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_9 \).
   - Each person \( P_i \) knows \( P_{i-1} \), \( P_{i+1} \), and \( P_{i+5} \) (considering modulo 10).

3. **Pairing Strategy:**
   - We need to form 5 pairs such that each pair consists of people who know each other.
   - We need to ensure that each person is in exactly one pair.

4. **Counting Valid Pairings:**
   - We need to count the number of valid ways to form these pairs.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to help with the counting.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the number of people
n = 10

# Create a graph representation
# Each person knows 3 others: adjacent and directly across
adjacency = {i: [(i-1) % n, (i+1) %","Consider the $10$ people to be standing in a circle, where two people opposite each other form a diameter of the circle.
Let us use casework on the number of pairs that form a diameter of the circle.
Case 1: $0$ diameters
There are $2$ ways: either $1$ pairs with $2$ $3$ pairs with $4$ , and so on or $10$ pairs with $1$ $2$ pairs with $3$ , etc.
Case 2: $1$ diameter
There are $5$ possible diameters to draw (everyone else pairs with the person next to them).
Note that there cannot be $2$ diameters since there would be one person on either side that will not have a pair adjacent to them. The only scenario forced is when the two people on either side would be paired up across a diameter. Thus, a contradiction will arise.
Case 3: $3$ diameters
There are $5$ possible sets of $3$ diameters to draw.
Notice we are technically choosing the number of ways to choose a pair of two diameters that are neighbors to each other. This means we can choose the first diameter in the pair, and have only two diameters to choose from for the second in the pair. This means we have $5*2=10$ possibilities for choosing 5 neighboring diameters. However, notice that there are duplicates, so we divide the $10$ possibilities by $2$ to get $5$
Note that there cannot be a case with $4$ diameters because then there would have to be $5$ diameters for the two remaining people as they have to be connected with a diameter. A contradiction arises.
Case 4: $5$ diameters
There is only $1$ way to do this.
Thus, in total there are $2+5+5+1=\boxed{13}$ possible ways.

2. **Operations:**
   George performs four operations:
   - In each operation, he draws a ball randomly from the urn.
   - He then adds a matching ball (either a red ball if he drew a red ball or a blue ball if he drew a blue ball) back into the urn.

Now, suppose that we have this deck again, with only one black card. Each time we pick a red ball, we place a card above the black card, and each time we pick a blue ball, we place a card below the black card. It is easy to see that the probability that the card is inserted into the top part of the deck is simply equal to the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls, and the probability that the card is inserted into the bottom part of the deck is equal to the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls. Therefore, this is equivalent to inserting the card randomly into the deck.
Finally, four more red cards will be inserted into the deck, and so the black card can be in five possible positions. Only one corresponds to having three balls of each type. Our probability is thus $\frac{1}{5}$ , and so the answer is $\boxed{15}$"

There are 6 cases: $RRBB, RBRB, RBBR, BBRR, BRBR, BRRB$ (we can confirm that there are only $6$ since $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ). However we can clump $RRBB + BBRR$ $RBRB + BRBR$ , and $RBBR + BRRB$ together since they are equivalent by symmetry.
$\textbf{CASE 1: }$ $RRBB$ and $BBRR$
Let's find the probability that he picks the balls in the order of $RRBB$
The probability that the first ball he picks is red is $\frac{1}{2}$
Now there are $2$ reds and $1$ blue in the urn. The probability that he picks red again is now $\frac{2}{3}$
There are $3$ reds and $1$ blue now. The probability that he picks a blue is $\frac{1}{4}$
Finally, there are $3$ reds and $2$ blues. The probability that he picks a blue is $\frac{2}{5}$
So the probability that the $RRBB$ case happens is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ . However, since the $BBRR$ case is the exact same by symmetry, case 1 has a probability of $\frac{1}{30} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{15}$ chance of happening.

There are $2$ reds and $2$ blues now. The probability that he picks a red is $\frac{1}{2}$
Finally, there are $3$ reds and $2$ blues. The probability that he picks a blue is $\frac{2}{5}$
So the probability that the $RBRB$ case happens is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ . However, since the $BRBR$ case is the exact same by symmetry, case 2 has a probability of $\frac{1}{30} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{15}$ chance of happening.

So the probability that the $RBBR$ case happens is $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ . However, since the $BRRB$ case is the exact same by symmetry, case 3 has a probability of $\frac{1}{30} \cdot 2 = \frac{1}{15}$ chance of happening.
Adding up the cases, we have $\frac{1}{15}+\frac{1}{15}+\frac{1}{15}=\boxed{15}$ ~quacker88"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after four iterations of drawing and adding matching balls, the urn contains exactly three red balls and three blue balls.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   The urn starts with 1 red ball and 1 blue ball.

2. **Operations:**
   George performs four operations:
   - In each operation, he draws a ball randomly from the urn.
   - He then adds a matching ball (either a red ball if he drew a red ball or a blue ball if he drew a blue ball) back into the urn.

3. **Final Condition:**
   After four iterations, the urn contains six balls, three of each color.

4. **Objective:**
   We need to calculate the probability that after the four operations, the urn contains exactly three red balls and three blue balls.

Let's use Python and sympy to simulate this process and calculate the probability.

```python
import sympy as sp

    # Draw a ball (uniformly","We know that we need to find the probability of adding 2 red and 2 blue balls in some order.
There are 6 ways to do this, since there are $\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to arrange $RRBB$ in some order.
We will show that the probability for each of these 6 ways is the same.
We first note that the denominators should be counted by the same number. This number is $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5=120$ . This is because 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent how many choices there are for the four steps. No matter what the $k-th$ step involves $k+1$ numbers to choose from.
The numerators are the number of successful operations. No matter the order, the first time a red is added will come from 1 choice and the second time will come from 2 choices, since that is how many reds are in the urn originally.
The same goes for the blue ones. The numerator must equal $(1 \cdot 2)^2$
Therefore, the probability for each of the orderings of $RRBB$ is $\frac{4}{120}=\frac{1}{30}$ . There are 6 of these, so the total probability is $\boxed{15}$"

On George's first move, he either chooses the red or the blue with a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance each. We can assume he chooses Red(chance $\frac{1}{2}$ ), and then multiply the final answer by two for symmetry. Now, there are two red balls and one blue ball in the urn. Then, he can either choose another Red(chance $\frac{2}{3}$ ), in which case he must choose two blues to get three of each, with probability $\frac{1}{4}\cdot\frac{2}{5}=\frac{1}{10}$ or a blue for two blue and two red in the urn, with chance $\frac{1}{3}$ . If he chooses blue next, he can either choose a red then a blue, or a blue then a red. Each of these has a $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{2}{5}$ for total of $2\cdot\frac{1}{5}=\frac{2}{5}$ . The total probability that he ends up with three red and three blue is $2\cdot\frac{1}{2}(\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{5})=\frac{1}{15}+\frac{2}{15}=\boxed{15}$"

\[1+5+8+A+0+0+A+4+A+A+0=18+4A.\]
It follows that $4A$ cannot be a multiple of $3,$ ruling out choices $(B)$ and $(D).$ Therefore, our possibilities are $A=2,4,$ and $7.$ Now, notice that $\binom{52}{10}$ is divisible by $7.$ Therefore, we can plug each possible value of $A$ into $158A00A4AA0$ and test for divisibility by $7.$ Conveniently, we see that the first value, $A=2,$ works.

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the volume of the set \( S(r) \), which is the region within a distance \( r \) from the surface of a right rectangular prism \( B \) with edge lengths \( 1 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \).

The volume of \( S(r) \) can be broken down into several parts:
1. The volume of the prism \( B \) itself.
2. The volume of the extensions of the six faces of the prism.
3. The volume of the extensions of the twelve edges of the prism.
4. The volume of the sphere at each of the eight corners of the prism.

Let's calculate each part step-by-step and then find the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).

1. **Volume of the Prism \( B \):**
   The volume of the prism \( B \) is:
   \[
   \text{Volume of } B = 1 \times 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
   Therefore, \( d = 12 \).

2. **Volume of Extensions of the Faces:**
   Each face of the prism is a rectangle. There are 6 faces, and the extension of each face forms a right prism with a square base of side length \( r \) and height equal to the area of the face.
   \[
   \text{Area of","Split $S(r)$ into 4 regions:
1. The rectangular prism itself
2. The extensions of the faces of $B$
3. The quarter cylinders at each edge of $B$
4. The one-eighth spheres at each corner of $B$
Region 1: The volume of $B$ is $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 12$ , so $d=12$
Region 2: This volume is equal to the surface area of $B$ times $r$ (these ""extensions"" are just more boxes). The volume is then $\text{SA} \cdot r=2(1 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 4)r=38r$ to get $c=38$
Region 3: We see that there are 12 quarter-cylinders, 4 of each type. We have 4 quarter-cylinders of height 1, 4 quarter-cylinders of height 3, 4 quarter-cylinders of height 4. Since 4 quarter-cylinders make a full cylinder, the total volume is $4 \cdot \dfrac{1\pi r^2}{4} + 4 \cdot \dfrac{3\pi r^2}{4} + 4 \cdot \dfrac{4 \pi r^2}{4}=8 \pi r^2$ . Therefore, $b=8\pi$
Region 4: There is an eighth-sphere of radius $r$ at each corner of $B$ . Since there are 8 corners, these eighth-spheres add up to 1 full sphere of radius $r$ . The volume of this sphere is then $\frac{4}{3}\pi \cdot r^3$ , so $a=\frac{4\pi}{3}$
Using these values, $\dfrac{bc}{ad}=\frac{(8\pi)(38)}{(4\pi/3)(12)} = \boxed{19}$"

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. Define the variables and the expressions involved.
2. Compute the remainder using the modulo operation.

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the base and exponents
base = 2
exp_large = 202
exp_small1 = 101
exp_small2 = 51
constant = 202

# Define the large number and the divisor
large_number = base ** exp_large + constant
divisor = base ** exp_small1 + base ** exp_small2 + 1

# Compute the remainder
remainder = sp.Mod(large_number, divisor)

print(remainder)

","Let $x=2^{50}$ . We are now looking for the remainder of $\frac{4x^4+202}{2x^2+2x+1}$
We could proceed with polynomial division, but the numerator looks awfully similar to the Sophie Germain Identity ,  which states that \[a^4+4b^4=(a^2+2b^2+2ab)(a^2+2b^2-2ab)\]
Let's use the identity, with $a=1$ and $b=x$ , so we have
\[1+4x^4=(1+2x^2+2x)(1+2x^2-2x)\]
Rearranging, we can see that this is exactly what we need:
\[\frac{4x^4+1}{2x^2+2x+1}=2x^2-2x+1\]
So \[\frac{4x^4+202}{2x^2+2x+1} = \frac{4x^4+1}{2x^2+2x+1} +\frac{201}{2x^2+2x+1}\]
Since the first half divides cleanly as shown earlier, the remainder must be $\boxed{201}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
\]

Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{n+1000}{70} = k \quad \text{where} \quad k = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   n + 1000 = 70k \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 70k - 1000
   \]

2. **Constraints on \( n \):**
   Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have:
   \[
   70k - 1000 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k > \frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857
   \]
   Therefore, \( k \) must be an integer greater than 14. Also, \( k \) must satisfy:
   \[
   k \leq \sqrt{n} < k+1
   \]
   Substituting \( n = 70k - 1000 \) into the inequality:
   \[
   k \leq \sqrt{70k - 1000} < k+1
   \]

3. **Iterate to Find Valid \( k \):**
   We need to find the integer values of \( k \) that satisfy the inequality above.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the valid values of \( k \) and count the","We can first consider the equation without a floor function:
\[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \sqrt{n}\]
Multiplying both sides by 70 and then squaring:
\[n^2 + 2000n + 1000000 = 4900n\]
Moving all terms to the left:
\[n^2 - 2900n + 1000000 = 0\]
Now we can determine the factors:
\[(n-400)(n-2500) = 0\]
This means that for $n = 400$ and $n = 2500$ , the equation will hold without the floor function.
Now we can simply check the multiples of 70 around 400 and 2500 in the original equation, which we abbreviate as $L=R$
For $n = 330$ $L=19$ but $18^2 < 330 < 19^2$ so $R=18$
For $n = 400$ $L=20$ and $R=20$
For $n = 470$ $L=21$ $R=21$
For $n = 540$ $L=22$ but $540 > 23^2$ so $R=23$
Now we move to $n = 2500$
For $n = 2430$ $L=49$ and $49^2 < 2430 < 50^2$ so $R=49$
For $n = 2360$ $L=48$ and $48^2 < 2360 < 49^2$ so $R=48$
For $n = 2290$ $L=47$ and $47^2 < 2360 < 48^2$ so $R=47$
For $n = 2220$ $L=46$ but $47^2 < 2220$ so $R=47$
For $n = 2500$ $L=50$ and $R=50$
For $n = 2570$ $L=51$ but $2570 < 51^2$ so $R=50$
Therefore we have 6 total solutions, $n = 400, 470, 2290, 2360, 2430, 2500 = \boxed{6}$"

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the valid values of \( k \) and count the","This is my first solution here, so please forgive me for any errors.
We are given that \[\frac{n+1000}{70}=\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor\]
$\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$ must be an integer, which means that $n+1000$ is divisible by $70$ . As $1000\equiv 20\pmod{70}$ , this means that $n\equiv 50\pmod{70}$ , so we can write $n=70k+50$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$
Therefore, \[\frac{n+1000}{70}=\frac{70k+1050}{70}=k+15=\lfloor\sqrt{70k+50}\rfloor\]
Also, we can say that $\sqrt{70k+50}-1 < k+15$ and $k+15\leq\sqrt{70k+50}$
Squaring the second inequality, we get $k^{2}+30k+225\leq70k+50\implies k^{2}-40k+175\leq 0\implies (k-5)(k-35)\leq0\implies 5\leq k\leq 35$
Similarly solving the first inequality gives us $k < 19-\sqrt{155}$ or $k > 19+\sqrt{155}$
$\sqrt{155}$ is larger than $12$ and smaller than $13$ , so instead, we can say $k\leq 6$ or $k\geq 32$
Combining this with $5\leq k\leq 35$ , we get $k=5,6,32,33,34,35$ are all solutions for $k$ that give a valid solution for $n$ , meaning that our answer is $\boxed{6}$ .

This means that \[\dfrac{n+1000}{70} \leq \sqrt{n} < \dfrac{n+1070}{70}\] Solving each inequality separately gives us two inequalities: \[n - 70\sqrt{n} +1000 \leq 0 \rightarrow (\sqrt{n}-50)(\sqrt{n}-20)\leq 0 \rightarrow 20\leq \sqrt{n} \leq 50\] \[n-70\sqrt{n}+1070 > 0 \rightarrow \sqrt{n} < 35-\sqrt{155} , \sqrt{n} > 35+\sqrt{155}\] Simplifying and approximating decimals yields 2 solutions for one inequality and 4 for the other.

Since $\lfloor x \rfloor \leq x < \lfloor x \rfloor +1$ for all real $x$ , we can take $x=\sqrt{70j-20}$ with $\lfloor x \rfloor =j+14$ to get \[j+14 \leq \sqrt{70j-20} < j+15\] We can square the inequality to get \[196+28j+j^{2} \leq 70j-20 < 225 + 30j + j^{2}\] The left inequality simplifies to $(j-36)(j-6) \leq 0$ , which yields \[6 \le j \le 36.\] The right inequality simplifies to $(j-20)^2 - 155 > 0$ , which yields \[j < 20 - \sqrt{155} < 8 \quad \text{or} \quad j > 20 + \sqrt{155} > 32\]

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation:

\[
\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
\]

Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \frac{n+1000}{70} = k \quad \text{where} \quad k = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   n + 1000 = 70k \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 70k - 1000
   \]

2. **Constraints on \( n \):**
   Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have:
   \[
   70k - 1000 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k > \frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857
   \]
   Therefore, \( k \) must be an integer greater than 14. Also, \( k \) must satisfy:
   \[
   k \leq \sqrt{n} < k+1
   \]
   Substituting \( n = 70k - 1000 \) into the inequality:
   \[
   k \leq \sqrt{70k - 1000} < k+1
   \]

3. **Iterate to Find Valid \( k \):**
   We need to find the integer values of \( k \) that satisfy the inequality above.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the valid values of \( k \) and count the","Set $x=\sqrt{n}$ in the given equation and solve for $x$ to get $x^2 = 70 \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor - 1000$ .

Solving $k >46$ , and $20 \le k \le 50$ , we get $46 < k \le 50$ , for $4$ values $k\in \{47, \ldots , 50\}$

3. **Iterate to Find Valid \( k \):**
   We need to find the integer values of \( k \) that satisfy the inequality above.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the valid values of \( k \) and count the","If $n$ is a perfect square, we can write $n = k^2$ for a positive integer $k$ , so $\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = \sqrt{n} = k.$ The given equation turns into
\begin{align*}
\frac{k^2 + 1000}{70} &= k \\
k^2 - 70k + 1000 &= 0 \\
(k-20)(k-50) &= 0,
\end{align*}
so $k = 20$ or $k= 50$ , so $n = 400, 2500.$
If $n$ is not square, then we can say that, for a positive integer $k$ , we have 
\begin{align*}
k^2 < &n < (k+1)^2 \\
k^2 + 1000 < &n + 1000  = 70\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = 70k< (k+1)^2 + 1000 \\
k^2 + 1000 < &70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000.
\end{align*}
To solve this inequality, we take the intersection of the two solution sets to each of the two inequalities $k^2 + 1000 < 70k$ and $70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000$ . To solve the first one, we have
\begin{align*}
k^2 - 70k + 1000 &< 0 \\
(k-20)(k-50) &< 0\\
\end{align*} $k\in (20, 50),$ because the portion of the parabola between its two roots will be negative.
The second inequality yields
\begin{align*}
70k &< k^2 + 2k + 1 + 1000 \\
0 &< k^2 -68k + 1001.
\end{align*}
This time, the inequality will hold for all portions of the parabola that are not on or between the its two roots, which are $34 + \sqrt{155}>46$ and $34-\sqrt{155}<22$ (they are roughly equal, but this is to ensure that we do not miss any solutions).
Notation wise, we need all integers $k$ such that
\[k \in \left(20, 50\right) \cap \left(-\infty,34 - \sqrt{155} \right)\] or \[k \in \left(20, 50\right) \cap \left(34 + \sqrt{155}, \infty \right).\]
For the first one, since our uppoer bound is a little less than $22$ , the $k$ that works is $21$ . For the second, our lower bound is a little more than $46$ , so the $k$ that work are $47, 48,$ and $49$

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding \( D(96) \), we need to determine the number of ways to write the number 96 as a product of factors greater than 1, where the order of factors matters.

We can approach this problem by considering the prime factorization of 96:
\[ 96 = 2^5 \times 3 \]

We need to find all possible ways to partition this number into products of factors greater than 1, and count the permutations of each partition.

Let's break it down into steps:

2. **Generate all factor combinations:**

$k=1$ : We see that there is $1$ way, merely $96$
$k=2$ : This way, we have the $3$ in one slot and $2$ in another, and symmetry. The four other $2$ 's leave us with $5$ ways and symmetry doubles us so we have $10$
$k=3$ : We have $3, 2, 2$ as our baseline. We need to multiply by $2$ in $3$ places, and see that we can split the remaining three powers of $2$ in a manner that is $3-0-0$ $2-1-0$ or $1-1-1$ . A $3-0-0$ split has $6 + 3 = 9$ ways of happening ( $24-2-2$ and symmetry; $2-3-16$ and symmetry), a $2-1-0$ split has $6 \cdot 3 = 18$ ways of happening (due to all being distinct) and a $1-1-1$ split has $3$ ways of happening ( $6-4-4$ and symmetry) so in this case we have $9+18+3=30$ ways.
$k=4$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2$ as our baseline, and for the two other $2$ 's, we have a $2-0-0-0$ or $1-1-0-0$ split. The former grants us $4+12=16$ ways ( $12-2-2-2$ and symmetry and $3-8-2-2$ and symmetry) and the latter grants us also $12+12=24$ ways ( $6-4-2-2$ and symmetry and $3-4-4-2$ and symmetry) for a total of $16+24=40$ ways.
$k=5$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2, 2$ as our baseline and one place to put the last two: on another two or on the three. On the three gives us $5$ ways due to symmetry and on another two gives us $5 \cdot 4 = 20$ ways due to symmetry. Thus, we have $5+20=25$ ways.
$k=6$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2$ and symmetry and no more twos to multiply, so by symmetry, we have $6$ ways.
Thus, adding, we have $1+10+30+40+25+6=\boxed{112}$"

First, the factorization needs to contain one factor that is itself a multiple of $3$ . There are $k$ to choose from. That leaves $k-1$ slots left to fill, each of which must contain at least one factor of $2$ . Once we have filled in a $2$ to each of the remaining slots, we're left with $5-(k-1)=6-k$ twos.
Consider the remaining $6-k$ factors of $2$ left to assign to the $k$ factors. Using stars and bars, the number of ways to do this is: \[{{(6-k)+k-1}\choose{6-k}}={5\choose{6-k}}\] This makes $k{5\choose{6-k}}$ possibilities for each k.

For each choice of $f_1$ , the resulting $f_2...f_k$ must have a product of $96/f_1$ . This means the number of ways the rest $f_a$ $1<a<=k$ can be written by the scheme stated in the problem for each $f_1$ is equal to $D(96/f_1)$ , since the product of $f_2 \cdot f_3... \cdot f_k=x$ is counted as one valid product if and only if $f_1 \cdot x=96$ , the product $x$ has the properties that factors are greater than $1$ , and differently ordered products are counted separately.
For example, say the first factor is $2$ . Then, the remaining numbers must multiply to $48$ , so the number of ways the product can be written beginning with $2$ is $D(48)$ . To add up all the number of solutions for every possible starting factor, $D(96/f_1)$ must be calculated and summed for all possible $f_1$ , except $96$ and $1$ , since a single $1$ is not counted according to the problem statement. The $96$ however, is counted, but only results in $1$ possibility, the first and only factor being $96$ . This means
$D(96)=D(48)+D(32)+D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1$
Instead of calculating D for the larger factors first, reduce $D(48)$ $D(32)$ , and $D(24)$ into sums of $D(m)$ where $m<=16$ to ease calculation. Following the recursive definition $D(n)=($ sums of $D(c))+1$ where c takes on every divisor of n except for 1 and itself, the sum simplifies to
$D(96)=(D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1)$ $(D(16)+D(8)+D(4)+D(2)+1)+D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1.$
$D(24)=D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1$ , so the sum further simplifies to
$D(96)=3D(16)+4D(12)+5D(8)+4D(6)+5D(4)+4D(3)+5D(2)+5$ , after combining terms. From quick casework,
$D(16)=8, D(12)=8, D(8)=4, D(6)=3, D(4)=2, D(3)=1$ and $D(2)=1$ . Substituting these values into the expression above,

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding \( D(96) \), we need to determine the number of ways to write the number 96 as a product of factors greater than 1, where the order of factors matters.

We can approach this problem by considering the prime factorization of 96:
\[ 96 = 2^5 \times 3 \]

We need to find all possible ways to partition this number into products of factors greater than 1, and count the permutations of each partition.

Let's break it down into steps:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   \[ 96 = 2^5 \times 3 \]

2. **Generate all factor combinations:**
   We need to consider all possible ways to split \( 96 \) into products of factors greater than 1.

3. **Count permutations of each combination:**
   Each combination can be ordered in different ways, so we need to count all permutations for each combination.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy and itertools to generate and count the partitions.

```python
import sympy as sp
from itertools import permutations

def count_partitions(n):
    prime_factors = sp.factorint(n)
    factors = []
    for base, exp in prime_factors.items():
        factors.extend([base] * exp","Consider the arrangement of the prime factors of 96 in a line $(2,2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$ .  An arrangement of factors can be created by placing ""dividers"" to group primes.  For example, $(2, 2, |, 2, 2, 2, |, 3)$ is equivalent to the arrangement $4 \cdot 8 \cdot 3$ .  Because there are $6$ ways to order the prime factors, and $2^5$ ways to place dividers, this gives us an initial $6 \cdot  2^5$ ways to arrange divisors.
However, through this method, we overcount cases where $3$ is combined with another factor.  For example, the arrangement $4 \cdot 6 \cdot 4$ can be written as $(2, 2, |, 2, 3, |, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 2, |, 3, 2, |, 2, 2)$ .  Precisely, we double count any case with $6$ as a factor, triple count any case with $12$ , quadruple count any case with $24$ , etc.
Now, consider all cases where $3$ must be grouped with at least one $2$ .  This can be expressed in the same ""line"" format as $(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)$ , where dividers can again be placed to group divisors.  In this case, there are $5$ ways to order divisors, and $2^4$ ways to place dividers, so we have an $5 \cdot 2^4$ possible sequences for this case.  Notice that in this format, we double count cases where $12$ is a factor, we triple count cases where $24$ is a factor, etc.  Precisely, for any case counted $n$ times in the first step, it is counted $n - 1$ times in this step.  Thus, if we subtract, we count each case exactly once.
So, we get:
$6 \cdot  2^5 - 5 \cdot 2^4 = \boxed{112}$ . ~ hdai1122"

"A box contains $28$ red balls, $20$ green balls, $19$ yellow balls, $13$ blue balls, $11$ white balls, and $9$ black balls. What is the minimum number of balls that must be drawn from the box without replacement to guarantee that at least $15$ balls of a single color will be drawn?

What is the minimum number of balls that must be drawn from the box without replacement to guarantee that at least $15$ balls of a single color will be drawn?
$\textbf{(A) } 75 \qquad\textbf{(B) } 76 \qquad\textbf{(C) } 79 \qquad\textbf{(D) } 84 \qquad\textbf{(E) } 91$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of balls that must be drawn from the box to guarantee that at least 15 balls of a single color will be drawn. 

We can use the pigeonhole principle to solve this problem. The pigeonhole principle states that if \(n\) items are put into \(m\) containers, with \(n > m\), then at least one container must contain more than one item.

Here, we have six different colors of balls, and we want to ensure that we have at least 15 balls of one color. 

To apply the pigeonhole principle:
1. If we try to avoid having 15 balls of any single color, we can distribute the balls as evenly as possible among the six colors.
2. We need to calculate the maximum number of balls we can draw without having 15 balls of any color.

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the maximum number of balls we can draw without having 15 balls of any color:**
   - We can draw at most 14 balls of each color without having 15 balls of any color.
   - Therefore, the total number of balls we can draw without having 15 balls of any color is \(14 \times 6 = 84\).

2. **Determine the number of balls needed to guarantee 15 balls of one color:**
   - After drawing 84 balls (where each color has at most 14 balls), drawing one more ball (the 85th ball) will ensure that we have 15 balls of one color.

Thus, the minimum number of balls that must be drawn to guarantee that","We try to find the worst case scenario where we can find the maximum number of balls that can be drawn while getting $<15$ of each color by applying the pigeonhole principle and through this we get a perfect guarantee. 
Namely, we can draw up to $14$ red balls, $14$ green balls, $14$ yellow balls, $13$ blue balls, $11$ white balls, and $9$ black balls, for a total of $75$ balls, without drawing $15$ balls of any one color. Drawing one more ball guarantees that we will get $15$ balls of one color — either red, green, or yellow. Thus, the answer is $75 + 1 = \boxed{76}$"

### Solution: To find the greatest number of consecutive integers whose sum is 45, we need to consider the properties of arithmetic sequences.

Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \( a \) and the number of terms by \( n \). The sum of the first \( n \) consecutive integers starting from \( a \) can be given by the formula:

   \[ 2a + n - 1 = \frac{90}{n} \]
   \[ 2a = \frac{90}{n} - n + 1 \]
   \[ a = \frac{\frac{90}{n} - n + 1}{2} \]

3. **Ensure \( a \) is an integer:**
   \[ \frac{90}{n} - n + 1 \] must be an even integer.

4. **Find the maximum value of \( n \) such that \( a \) is a positive integer.**

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy to find the maximum value of \( n \).

```python

### Solution: To determine how many types of quadrilaterals exist such that there is a point in the plane equidistant from all four vertices, we need to consider the geometric properties of quadrilaterals.

A point that is equidistant from all four vertices of a quadrilateral is the circumcenter, which is the center of the circle that passes through all four vertices of the quadrilateral. Therefore, the quadrilateral must be cyclic (i.e., a quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle).

We need to check which types of quadrilaterals are cyclic:

1. **Convex Quadrilateral**: Any quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle is cyclic.
2. **Parallelogram**: A parallelogram is always cyclic because opposite angles are supplementary.
3. **Rectangle**: A rectangle is a special type of parallelogram and is always cyclic.

1. **Find the equations of the lines:**
   - The line with slope \(\frac{1}{2}\) passing through \((2,2)\):
     \[
     y - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 2)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1
     \]
   - The line with slope \(2\) passing through \((2,2)\):
     \[
     y - 2 = 2(x - 2)

     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x + \frac{1}{2}x + 1 = 10 \implies \frac{3}{2}x + 1 = 10 \implies \frac{3}{2}x = 9 \implies x = 6

Also, $x+y=10$ implies $y=-x+10$ . Thus the lines are $y=\frac{x}{2} +1, y=2x-2,$ and $y=-x+10$ .

   - The line with slope \(\frac{1}{2}\) passing through \((2,2)\):
     \[
     y - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 2)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1
     \]
   - The line with slope \(2\) passing through \((2,2)\):
     \[
     y - 2 = 2(x - 2)
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     y = 2x - 2
     \]
   - The given line is:

     x + y = 10
     \]

2. **Find the points of intersection:**
   - Intersection of \(y = \frac{1}{2}x + 1\) and \(x + y = 10\):
     \[
     x + \left(\frac{1}{2}x + 1\right) = 10
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x + \frac{1}{2}x + 1 = 10 \implies \frac{3}{2}x + 1 = 10 \implies \frac{3}{2}x = 9 \implies x = 6

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest three-digit positive integer \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is not a divisor of the product of the first \( n \) positive integers.

1. **Sum of the First \( n \) Positive Integers:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Product of the First \( n \) Positive Integers:**
   The product of the first \( n \) positive integers (factorial of \( n \)) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = n!
   \]

3. **Condition for \( S_n \) not being a divisor of \( P_n \):**
   We need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( S_n \) does not divide \( P_n \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check each \( n \) from 999 down to 100 and find the largest \( n \) that satisfies the condition.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
n = sp.symbols('n')

# Define the sum of the first n positive integers
S_n = n * (n + 1) // 2

# Define the product of the first n positive integers (factorial of n)
P_n = sp.factorial(n)

# Function to check if S_n is a divisor of P_n
def is_divisor(n):
    S_n_val = S_n.subs(n, n)
    P_n_val = P_n.subs(n, n)
    return P_","The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2}$ , and we want this not to be a divisor of $n!$ (the product of the first $n$ positive integers). Notice that if and only if $n+1$ were composite, all of its factors would be less than or equal to $n$ , which means they would be able to cancel with the factors in $n!$ . Thus, the sum of $n$ positive integers would be a divisor of $n!$ when $n+1$ is composite. (Note: This is true for all positive integers except for 1 because 2 is not a divisor/factor of 1.)

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest three-digit positive integer \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is not a divisor of the product of the first \( n \) positive integers.

1. **Sum of the First \( n \) Positive Integers:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Product of the First \( n \) Positive Integers:**
   The product of the first \( n \) positive integers (factorial of \( n \)) is given by:
   \[
   P_n = n!
   \]

3. **Condition for \( S_n \) not being a divisor of \( P_n \):**
   We need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( S_n \) does not divide \( P_n \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check each \( n \) from 999 down to 100 and find the largest \( n \) that satisfies the condition.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
n = sp.symbols('n')

# Define the sum of the first n positive integers
S_n = n * (n + 1) // 2

    S_n_val = S_n.subs(n, n)
    P_n_val = P_n.subs(n, n)
    return P_","As in Solution 1, we deduce that $n+1$ must be prime. If we can't immediately recall what the greatest three-digit prime is, we can instead use this result to eliminate answer choices as possible values of $n$ . Choices $A$ $C$ , and $E$ don't work because $n+1$ is even, and all even numbers are divisible by two, which makes choices $A$ $C$ , and $E$ composite and not prime. Choice $D$ also does not work since $999$ is divisible by $9$ , which means it's a composite number and not prime. Thus, the correct answer must be $\boxed{996}$"

### Solution: To determine how many tiles the bug visits when it walks from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner in a straight line, we can use the formula for counting the number of grid cells a line segment crosses in a grid.

The formula for the number of tiles a line crosses is given by:
\[ \text{Number of tiles crossed} = \text{width} + \text{length} - \text{gcd(width, length)} \]
where gcd is the greatest common divisor.

Given:
- Width (\( w \)) = 10 feet
- Length (\( l \)) = 17 feet

We need to calculate:
\[ \text{Number of tiles crossed} = 10 + 17 - \text{gcd}(10, 17) \]

Let's calculate this using Python.
```python
import math

# Given dimensions
width = 10
length = 17

# Calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd)
gcd_value = math.gcd(width, length)

# Calculate the number of tiles the bug visits
tiles_visited = width + length - gcd_value
print(tiles_visited)
```
```output
26
```
The bug visits a total of \(\boxed{26}\) tiles when walking from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner in a straight line.
","The number of tiles the bug visits is equal to $1$ plus the number of times it crosses a horizontal or vertical line.  As it must cross $16$ horizontal lines and $9$ vertical lines, it must be that the bug visits a total of $16+9+1 = \boxed{26}$ squares."

","We can also draw a diagram or scale model of the entire rectangular floor (optionally with grid paper and/or a ruler so it will be to scale), then simply count the number of tiles the path crosses. To make this slightly easier, we can divide the full grid into $4$ sections, and just draw one of these $5$ feet by $8.5$ feet sections.
[asy] unitsize(20); for(int i =0; i<= 7; ++i) { for(int j =0; j<= 4; ++j) { draw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--cycle); }  for(int k =0; k<= 4; ++k) { draw((8,k)--(8.5,k)--(8.5,k+1)--(8,k+1)--cycle); }  }  draw((0,5)--(8.5,0)--cycle); [/asy]
Though it may appear that the line we drew comes very close to several points, we know that since $10$ and $17$ are relatively prime (numbers where the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1, a.k.a. numbers with a gcd of 1), the line will not actually pass through any of these points, so the total number of squares crossed will be the same regardless of which side we count. If we count the number of squares the line passes through using the diagram, we get $13$ squares. We can then multiply this by 2 to find out the total number of squares the bug passes through on the rectangular floor giving us a total of $2 \cdot 13 = \boxed{26}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding how many positive integer divisors of \(201^9\) are perfect squares, perfect cubes, or both, we can follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of 201**:
   First, find the prime factorization of 201.
   \[
   201 = 3 \times 67
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   201^9 = (3 \times 67)^9 = 3^9 \times 67^9
   \]

2. **Divisors of \(201^9\)**:
   Any divisor of \(201^9\) can be written in the form \(3^a \times 67^b\) where \(0 \leq a, b \leq 9\).

3. **Perfect Squares**:
   A divisor is a perfect square if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. The even numbers between 0 and 9 are {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Thus, there are 5 choices for \(a\) and 5 choices for \(b\).
   \[
   \text{Number of perfect squares} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

4. **Perfect Cubes**:
   A divisor is a perfect cube if both \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of 3. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 9 are {0, 3, 6}. Thus, there are 3 choices for \(a\) and 3 choices for \(b\).
   \[
   \text{Number of perfect cubes} = 3 \times 3 = 9

   A divisor is a perfect sixth power if both \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of 6. The multiples of 6 between ","Prime factorizing $201^9$ , we get $3^9\cdot67^9$ . 
A perfect square must have even powers of its prime factors, so our possible choices for our exponents to get perfect square are $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$ for both $3$ and $67$ . This yields $5\cdot5 = 25$ perfect squares.
Perfect cubes must have multiples of $3$ for each of their prime factors' exponents, so we have either $0, 3, 6$ , or $9$ for both $3$ and $67$ , which yields $4\cdot4 = 16$ perfect cubes, for a total of $25+16 = 41$
Subtracting the overcounted powers of $6$ $3^0\cdot67^0$ $3^0\cdot67^6$ $3^6\cdot67^0$ , and $3^6\cdot67^6$ ), we get $41-4 = \boxed{37}$"

Case 1 : The factor is $3^n$ . Then we can have $n = 2$ $3$ $4$ $6$ $8$ , or $9$
Case 2 : The factor is $67^n$ . This is the same as Case 1.
Case 3 : The factor is some combination of $3$ s and $67$ s.
This would be easy if we could just have any combination, as that would simply give $6 \cdot 6$ . However, we must pair the numbers that generate squares with the numbers that generate squares and the same for cubes. In simpler terms, let's organize our values for $n$
$n = 2$ is a ""square"" because it would give a factor of this number that is a perfect square. More generally, it is even.
$n = 3$ is a ""cube"" because it would give a factor of this number that is a perfect cube. More generally, it is a multiple of $3$
$n = 4$ is a ""square"".
$n = 6$ is interesting, since it's both a ""square"" and a ""cube"". Don't count this as either because this would double-count, so we will count this in another case.
$n = 8$ is a ""square""
$n = 9$ is a ""cube"".
Now let's consider subcases:
Subcase 1 : The squares are with each other.
Since we have $3$ square terms, and they would pair with $3$ other square terms, we get $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ possibilities.
Subcase 2 : The cubes are with each other.
Since we have $2$ cube terms, and they would pair with $2$ other cube terms, we get $2 \cdot 2 = 4$ possibilities.
Subcase 3 : A number pairs with $n=6$
Since any number can pair with $n=6$ (as it gives both a square and a cube), there would be $6$ possibilities. Remember however that there can be two different bases ( $3$ and $67$ ), and they would produce different results. Thus, there are in fact $6 \cdot 2 = 12$ possibilities.
Finally, summing the cases gives $6+6+9+4+12 = \boxed{37}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the given isosceles triangle and the circle with diameter \(BC\).

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Given an isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( BC = AC \) and \( \angle ACB = 40^\circ \).
   - Construct a circle with diameter \( BC \). This circle intersects \( AC \) at \( D \) and \( AB \) at \( E \).
   - We need to find the degree measure of \( \angle BFC \), where \( F \) is the intersection of the diagonals \( BD \) and \( CE \) of quadrilateral \( BCDE \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Since \( BC \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle BDC \) and \( \angle BEC \) are right angles (90 degrees).
   - The quadrilateral \( BCDE \) is cyclic because all its vertices lie on the circle.
   - The diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at right angles (90 degrees).

3. **Using Symmetry and Geometry:**

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric properties of the given isosceles triangle and the circle with diameter \(BC\).

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Given an isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( BC = AC \) and \( \angle ACB = 40^\circ \).
   - Construct a circle with diameter \( BC \). This circle intersects \( AC \) at \( D \) and \( AB \) at \( E \).
   - We need to find the degree measure of \( \angle BFC \), where \( F \) is the intersection of the diagonals \( BD \) and \( CE \) of quadrilateral \( BCDE \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Since \( BC \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle BDC \) and \( \angle BEC \) are right angles (90 degrees).
   - The quadrilateral \( BCDE \) is cyclic because all its vertices lie on the circle.
   - The diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral intersect at right angles (90 degrees).

3. **Using Symmetry and Geometry:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( BC = AC \) and \( \angle ACB = 40^\circ \), the angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) are both \( 70^\circ \) (since \( 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ \) and \( 140^\circ","Alternatively, we could have used similar triangles. We start similarly to Solution 1.
Drawing it out, we see $\angle BDC$ and $\angle BEC$ are right angles, as they are inscribed in a semicircle. Therefore, \[\angle BDA = 180^{\circ} - \angle BDC = 180^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} = 90^{\circ}.\]
So, $\triangle BEF \sim BDA$ by AA Similarity, since $\angle EBF = \angle DBA$ and $\angle BEC = 90^{\circ} = \angle BDA$ . 
Thus, we know \[\angle EFB = \angle DAB = \angle CAB = 70^{\circ}.\]
Finally, we deduce \[\angle BFC = 180^{\circ} - \angle EFB = 180^{\circ} - 70^{\circ} = \boxed{110}.\]"

Adding the two equations gives us \[m\angle BFC + m\angle CAB = m\overarc{BC}\implies m\angle BFC=m\overarc{BC} - m\angle CAB\]
Since $\overarc{BC}$ is the diameter, $m\overarc{BC}=180^{\circ}$ , and because $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles and $m\angle ACB=40^{\circ}$ , we have $m\angle CAB=70^{\circ}$ . Thus \[m\angle BFC=180^{\circ}-70^{\circ}=\boxed{110}\]"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand the possible intersections of four distinct lines in a plane. Each pair of lines can intersect at most once, and the maximum number of intersections is determined by the combination of the lines taken two at a time.

Given four lines, the number of unique intersections can be calculated using combinations:
\[
\binom{4}{2} = 6
\]
This means that there can be at most 6 distinct intersection points if no three lines are concurrent and no two lines are parallel.

Let's consider the minimum number of intersections, which is 0 (when all lines are parallel).

We will now write Python code to iterate through all possible configurations of four lines and count the number of intersection points. We will use combinatorial geometry to determine the distinct intersection points.

Here's the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
import itertools

# Function to count intersections
def count_intersections(lines):
    intersections = set()
    for (l1, l2) in itertools.combinations(lines, 2):
        # Assuming generic lines that intersect uniquely
        intersection = (l1, l2)
        intersections.add(intersection)
    return len(intersections)

# Generate all possible configurations of four lines
def all_possible_configurations():
    configurations = []
    # Generate lines with various intersections points
    for lines in itertools.combinations(range(100, 104), 4):
        configurations.append(lines)
    return configurations

# Calculate all possible values of N
possible_values = set()
configurations = all_possible_configurations()
for config in configurations:
    possible_values.add(count_intersections(config))

# Sum all possible values of N
sum_of_all_possible_values = sum","It is possible to obtain $0$ $1$ $3$ $4$ $5$ , and $6$ points of intersection, as demonstrated in the following figures: [asy] unitsize(2cm); real d = 2.5; draw((-1,.6)--(1,.6),Arrows); draw((-1,.2)--(1,.2),Arrows); draw((-1,-.2)--(1,-.2),Arrows); draw((-1,-.6)--(1,-.6),Arrows);  draw((-1+d,0)--(1+d,0),Arrows); draw((0+d,1)--(0+d,-1),Arrows); draw(dir(45)+(d,0)--dir(45+180)+(d,0),Arrows); draw(dir(135)+(d,0)--dir(135+180)+(d,0),Arrows); dot((0+d,0));  draw((-1+2*d,sqrt(3)/3)--(1+2*d,sqrt(3)/3),Arrows); draw((-1/4-1/2+2*d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2)--(-1/4+1/2+2*d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2),Arrows); draw((1/4+1/2+2*d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2)--(1/4-1/2+2*d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2),Arrows); draw((-1+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6)--(1+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6),Arrows); dot((0+2*d,sqrt(3)/3)); dot((-1/2+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6)); dot((1/2+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6));  draw((-1/3,1-d)--(-1/3,-1-d),Arrows);  draw((1/3,1-d)--(1/3,-1-d),Arrows); draw((-1,-1/3-d)--(1,-1/3-d),Arrows); draw((-1,1/3-d)--(1,1/3-d),Arrows); dot((1/3,1/3-d)); dot((-1/3,1/3-d)); dot((1/3,-1/3-d)); dot((-1/3,-1/3-d));  draw((-1+d,sqrt(3)/12-d)--(1+d,sqrt(3)/12-d),Arrows); draw((-1/4-1/2+d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2-d)--(-1/4+1/2+d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2-d),Arrows); draw((1/4+1/2+d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2-d)--(1/4-1/2+d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2-d),Arrows); draw((-1+d,-sqrt(3)/6-d)--(1+d,-sqrt(3)/6-d),Arrows); dot((0+d,sqrt(3)/3-d)); dot((-1/2+d,-sqrt(3)/6-d)); dot((1/2+d,-sqrt(3)/6-d)); dot((-1/4+d,sqrt(3)/12-d)); dot((1/4+d,sqrt(3)/12-d));  draw((-1/4-1/2+2*d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2-d)--(-1/4+1/2+2*d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2-d),Arrows); draw((1/4+1/2+2*d, sqrt(3)/12-sqrt(3)/2-d)--(1/4-1/2+2*d,sqrt(3)/12+sqrt(3)/2-d),Arrows); draw(dir(30)+(2*d,-d)--dir(30+180)+(2*d,-d),Arrows); draw(dir(150)+(2*d,-d)--dir(-30)+(2*d,-d),Arrows); dot((0+2*d,0-d)); dot((0+2*d,sqrt(3)/3-d)); dot((-1/2+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6-d)); dot((1/2+2*d,-sqrt(3)/6-d)); dot((-1/4+2*d,sqrt(3)/12-d)); dot((1/4+2*d,sqrt(3)/12-d)); [/asy]
It is clear that the maximum number of possible intersections is ${4 \choose 2} = 6$ , since each pair of lines can intersect at most once.  We now prove that it is impossible to obtain two intersections.
We proceed by contradiction.  Assume a configuration of four lines exists such that there exist only two intersection points.  Let these intersection points be $A$ and $B$ .  Consider two cases:
Case 1 :  No line passes through both $A$ and $B$
Then, since an intersection point is obtained by an intersection between at least two lines, two lines pass through each of $A$ and $B$ .  Then, since there can be no additional intersections, the 2 lines that pass through $A$ cant intersect the 2 lines that pass through $B$ , and so 2 lines passing through $A$ must be parallel to 2 lines passing through $B$ . Then the two lines passing through $B$ are parallel to each other by transitivity of parallelism, so they coincide, contradiction.
Case 2 :  There is a line passing through $A$ and $B$
Then there must be a line $l_a$ passing through $A$ , and a line $l_b$ passing through $B$ .  These lines must be parallel.  The fourth line $l$ must pass through either $A$ or $B$ .  Without loss of generality, suppose $l$ passes through $A$ .  Then since $l$ and $l_a$ cannot coincide, they cannot be parallel.  Then $l$ and $l_b$ cannot be parallel either, so they intersect, contradiction.
All possibilities have been exhausted, and thus we can conclude that two intersections is impossible.  Our answer is given by the sum $0+1+3+4+5+6=\boxed{19}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different towers that can be built with a height of 8 cubes using 2 red cubes, 3 blue cubes, and 4 green cubes, with one cube left out. 

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Cubes and Colors:**
   - Total cubes: 9 (since we are using 2 red, 3 blue, and 4 green, adding up to 9)
   - One cube will be left out, so we are actually using 8 cubes.

2. **Permutations of the Cubes:**
   - We need to find the number of distinct permutations of the 8 cubes chosen from the 9 available.

3. **Calculate the Number of Different Towers:**
   - The number of permutations of 8 cubes chosen from the 9 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{9}{8}\), which is simply 9.

4. **Account for Identical Cubes:**
   - Since there are identical cubes of each color, we need to divide the total permutations by the factorial of the counts of each color to account for indistinguishable cubes.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to calculate the number of different towers:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the total number of cubes and the number of each color
total_cubes = 9
cubes_left_out = 1
red = 2
blue = 3
green = 4

# Calculate the number of ways to choose 8 cubes out of 9
num_ways_to_choose = sp.binomial(total_cubes, cubes_left_out)

#","Arranging eight cubes is the same as arranging the nine cubes first, and then removing the last cube. In other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between every arrangement of nine cubes, and every actual valid arrangement. Thus, we initially get $9!$ . However, we have overcounted, because the red cubes can be permuted to have the same overall arrangement, and the same applies with the blue and green cubes. Thus, we have to divide by the $2!$ ways to arrange the red cubes, the $3!$ ways to arrange the blue cubes, and the $4!$ ways to arrange the green cubes. Thus we have $\frac {9!} {2! \cdot 3! \cdot  4!} = \boxed{1,260}$ different possible towers."

Case 1 : The red cube is excluded. This gives us the problem of arranging one red cube, three blue cubes, and four green cubes. The number of possible arrangements is $\frac{8!}{4!\cdot3!}=280$ . Note that we do not need to multiply by the number of red cubes because there is no way to distinguish between the first red cube and the second.

   The repeating base-\( k \) representation \( 0.\overline{23}_k \) means that the fraction is of the form:
   \[
   \frac{2 \cdot k + 3}{k^2 + k + 1}
   \]
   This is because \( 0.\overline{23}_k \) can be written as the infinite series:
   \[
   0.232323\ldots_k = \frac{2}{k} + \frac{3}{k^2} + \frac{2}{k^3} + \frac{3}{k^4} + \ldots
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   We need to find \( k \) such that:
   \[
   \frac{7}{51} = \frac{2 \cdot k + 3}{k^2 + k + 1}
   \]

3. **Solve the equation:**
   We will solve the equation for \( k \) using sympy.

Let's implement this in Python to find the value of \( k \).

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
k = sp.symbols('k')

# Define the fraction equation
fraction_equation = sp.Eq(7 / 51, (2 * k + 3) / (k**2 + k","We can expand the fraction $0.\overline{23}_k$ as follows: $0.\overline{23}_k = 2\cdot k^{-1} + 3 \cdot k^{-2} + 2 \cdot k^{-3} + 3 \cdot k^{-4} + \cdots$
Notice that this is equivalent to \[2( k^{-1} + k^{-3} + k^{-5} + ... ) + 3 (k^{-2} + k^{-4} + k^{-6} + \cdots )\]
By summing the geometric series and simplifying, we have $\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \frac{7}{51}$ . Solving this quadratic equation (or simply testing the answer choices) yields the answer $k = \boxed{16}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding the least possible value of \((x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)+2019\) where \(x\) is a real number, we can follow these steps:

1. Define the function \(f(x) = (x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) + 2019\).
2. Simplify the expression \((x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)\).
3. Find the minimum value of the simplified function.
4. Add 2019 to the minimum value obtained.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the least possible value.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define the function
f = (x+1)*(x+2)*(x+3)*(x+4) + 2019

# Simplify the expression
f_simplified = sp.expand(f)

# Find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero
f_prime = sp.diff(f_simplified, x)
critical_points = sp.solve(f_prime, x)

# Evaluate the function at the critical points
min_value = float('inf')
for point in critical_points:
    value = f_simplified.subs(x, point)
    if value < min_value:
        min_value = value

# Also check the value at the boundaries if necessary (not required here as polynomial tends to infinity)
min_value = f_simplified.subs(x, min_value)

print(min_value)
```
```output
Traceback (","We can ignore the $2019$ and consider it later, as it is a constant. By difference of squares, we can group this into $\left((x+2.5)^2-0.5^2\right)\left((x+2.5)^2-1.5^2\right)$ . We pull a factor of $4$ into each term to avoid dealing with decimals:
\[\dfrac{\left((2x+5)^2-1\right)\left((2x+5)^2-9\right)}{16}.\]
Now, we let $a=2x+5$ . Our expression becomes:
\[\dfrac{(a-1)(a-9)}{16}=\dfrac{a^2-10a+9}{16}.\]
Taking the derivative, we get $\dfrac{2a-10}{16}=\dfrac{a-5}8.$ This is equal to $0$ when $a=5$ , and plugging in $a=5$ , we get the expression is equal to $-1$ and therefore our answer is $2019-1=\boxed{2018}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to keep track of which child is speaking and the range of numbers they need to say next. We will iterate through the sequence until we reach the 2019th number said by Tadd.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. Initialize the starting number, the current turn, and the count of numbers said so far.
2. Iterate through the sequence, updating the ranges based on the current child and speaking turns.
3. Keep track of the numbers said by each child, specifically focusing on Tadd's contributions.
4. Stop when we reach the 2019th number said by Tadd and return the corresponding number.

Let's implement this in Python:
```python
def find_2019th_tadd_number():
    # Initialize variables
    current_number = 1
    turn = 0  # 0 for Tadd, 1 for Todd, 2 for Tucker
    total_numbers_said = 0
    tadd_count = 0
    
    while True:
        # Determine the number of elements this child speaks
        num_elements = turn + 1
        # Determine the range of numbers this child speaks
        start = current_number
        end = start + num_elements - ","Define a round as one complete rotation through each of the three children, and define a turn as the portion when one child says his numbers (similar to how a game is played).
We create a table to keep track of what numbers each child says for each round.
$\begin{tabular}{||c c c c||}   \hline  Round & Tadd & Todd & Tucker \\ [0.5ex]   \hline\hline  1 & 1 & 2-3 & 4-6 \\   \hline  2 & 7-10 & 11-15 & 16-21 \\  \hline  3 & 22-28 & 29-36 & 37-45 \\  \hline  4 & 46-55 & 56-66 & 67-78 \\ [1ex]   \hline \end{tabular}$
Tadd says $1$ number in round 1, $4$ numbers in round 2, $7$ numbers in round 3, and in general $3n - 2$ numbers in round n. At the end of round n, the number of numbers Tadd has said so far is $1 + 4 + 7 + \dots + (3n - 2) = \frac{n(3n-1)}{2}$ , by the sum of arithmetic series formula.
We find that $\dfrac{37(110)}{2}=2035$ , so Tadd says his 2035th number at the end of his turn in round 37. That also means that Tadd says his 2019th number in round 37. At the end of Tadd's turn in round 37, the children have, in total, completed $36+36+37=109$ turns. In general, at the end of turn $n$ , the nth triangular number is said, or $\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ . So at the end of turn 109 (or the end of Tadd's turn in round 37), Tadd says the number $\dfrac{109(110)}{2}=5995$ . Recalling that this was the 2035th number said by Tadd, so the 2019th number he said was $5995-16=5979$
Thus, the answer is $\boxed{5979}$"

        # Determine the range of numbers this child speaks
        start = current_number
        end = start + num_elements - ","Firstly, as in Solution 1, we list how many numbers Tadd says, Todd says, and Tucker says in each round.
Tadd: $1, 4, 7, 10, 13 \cdots$
Todd: $2, 5, 8, 11, 14 \cdots$
Tucker: $3, 6, 9, 12, 15 \cdots$
We can find a general formula for the number of numbers each of the kids say after the $n$ th round. For Tadd, we can either use the arithmetic series sum formula (like in Solution 1) or standard summation results to get $\sum_{i=1}^n 3n-2=-2n+3\sum_{i=1}^n n=-2n+\frac{3n(n+1)}{2}=\frac{3n^2-n}{2}$
Now, to find the number of rotations Tadd and his siblings go through before Tadd says his $2019$ th number, we know the inequality $\frac{3n^2-n}{2}<2019$ must be satisfied, and testing numbers gives the maximum integer value of $n$ as $36$
The next main insight, in order to simplify the computation process, is to notice that the $2019$ th number Tadd says is simply the number of numbers Todd and Tucker say plus the $2019$ Tadd says, which will be the answer since Tadd goes first.
Carrying out the calculation thus becomes quite simple:
\[\left(\sum_{i=1}^{36} 3n+\sum_{i=1}^{36} 3n-1\right)+2019=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{36} 6n-1\right)+2019=(5+11+17...+215)+2019=\frac{36(220)}{2}+2019\]
At this point, we can note that the last digit of the answer is $9$ , which gives $\boxed{5979}$ . (Completing the calculation will confirm the answer, if you have time.)"

        start = current_number
        end = start + num_elements - ","Think of a turn as adding a block or an interval of numbers to each person. Here are the first couple ""blocks"" that Tadd has (a block will be denoted in interval notation): [ $1$ ], [ $7$ $10$ ], [ $22$ $28$ ], [ $46$ $55$ ]. From simple inspection, we can notice two things.
$1$ ) The start points of each interval is increasing arithmetically by $9$
$2$ ) The length of each ""block"" is increasing by $3$
Since each block length is increasing by 3, then we want $1$ $4$ $7$ +.. $3n-2$ $2019$ or $n(3n-1)/2 = 2019$ , where $n$ is the amount of blocks we have. In a short amount of time, you will see that $n$ is not an integer from that equation, but thats perfectly okay since we can just find an $n$ that gets it close to 2019, then we can work from there. From inspection, you will see that a good n value that does that exact job is $37$
We can then deduce that the start point of the $37$ th block will be $1+(6+15+24..+321) = 5887$ if we refer to fact $1$ . We can easily find the length of 37th block by $36*3+1 = 109$ if we refer to fact $2$ . Remember that the length increases by $3$ for each block. So we then can deduce that our endpoint for the 37th block is $5887+109-1 = 5995$ . The endpoint of the $37$ th block will be the $2035$ th number said because we can plug $37$ into $n(3n-1)/2$ , which tells us how many numbers Tadd has said where $n$ is the number of blocks Tadd has. From there we know that the $2019$ th number is in $37$ th block, so that means we can take our endpoint and subtract $2035-2019 = 16$ from the endpoint of the $37$ th block, which is $5995$ , so we get $5995-16 = 5979$ or $\boxed{5979}$ .

### Solution: To determine how many integers \( n \) between 1 and 50, inclusive, make \(\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}\) an integer, we need to analyze the given expression.

The expression \(\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}\) involves factorials in the numerator and powers of factorials in the denominator. We need to check when this fraction is an integer.

### Steps to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the factorial expression**:
   - The numerator is \((n^2-1)!\).
   - The denominator is \((n!)^n\).

2. **Check divisibility**:
   - We need to check when \((n^2-1)!\) is divisible by \((n!)^n\).

3. **Factorial properties**:
   - \((n!)^n\) contains all factors up to \(n\) raised to the \(n\)-th power.
   - \((n^2-1)!\) contains all integers from 1 to \(n^2-1\).

4. **Prime factors**:
   - For \((n^2-1)!\) to be divisible by \((n!)^n\), every prime factor in the denominator must appear with at least the same power in the numerator.

5. **Legendre’s formula**:
   - Use Legendre’s formula to determine the power of a prime \(p\) in \(n!\).
   - Extend it to \((n^2-1)!\) and \((n!)^n\).

6. **Iterate over the range**:
   - Iterate over each integer \(n\) from 1 to 50 and check if the given expression is an integer.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy","The main insight is that
\[\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\]
is always an integer. This is true because it is precisely the number of ways to split up $n^2$ objects into $n$ unordered groups of size $n$ . Thus,
\[\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}=\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\cdot\frac{n!}{n^2}\]
is an integer if $n^2 \mid n!$ , or in other words, if $\frac{(n-1)!}{n}$ , is an integer. This condition is false precisely when $n=4$ or $n$ is prime, by Wilson's Theorem . There are $15$ primes between $1$ and $50$ , inclusive, so there are $15 + 1 = 16$ terms for which
\[\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^{n}}\]
is potentially not an integer. It can be easily verified that the above expression is not an integer for $n=4$ as there are more factors of $2$ in the denominator than the numerator. Similarly, it can be verified that the above expression is not an integer for any prime $n=p$ , as there are more factors of p in the denominator than the numerator.

### Solution: To determine how many integers \( n \) between 1 and 50, inclusive, make \(\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}\) an integer, we need to analyze the given expression.

The expression \(\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}\) involves factorials in the numerator and powers of factorials in the denominator. We need to check when this fraction is an integer.

### Steps to solve the problem:

1. **Understand the factorial expression**:
   - The numerator is \((n^2-1)!\).
   - The denominator is \((n!)^n\).

2. **Check divisibility**:
   - We need to check when \((n^2-1)!\) is divisible by \((n!)^n\).

3. **Factorial properties**:
   - \((n!)^n\) contains all factors up to \(n\) raised to the \(n\)-th power.
   - \((n^2-1)!\) contains all integers from 1 to \(n^2-1\).

4. **Prime factors**:
   - For \((n^2-1)!\) to be divisible by \((n!)^n\), every prime factor in the denominator must appear with at least the same power in the numerator.

5. **Legendre’s formula**:
   - Use Legendre’s formula to determine the power of a prime \(p\) in \(n!\).
   - Extend it to \((n^2-1)!\) and \((n!)^n\).

6. **Iterate over the range**:
   - Iterate over each integer \(n\) from 1 to 50 and check if the given expression is an integer.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy","We can use the P-Adic Valuation (more info could be found here: Mathematicial notation ) of n to solve this problem (recall the P-Adic Valuation of 'n' is denoted by $v_p (n)$ and is defined as the greatest power of some prime 'p' that divides n. For example, $v_2 (6)=1$ or $v_7 (245)=2$ .) Using Legendre's formula, we know that :
\[v_p (n!)= \sum_{i=1}^\infty   \lfloor \frac {n}{p^i} \rfloor\]
Seeing factorials involved in the problem, this prompts us to use Legendre's Formula where n is a power of a prime.
We also know that , $v_p (m^n) = n \cdot v_p (m)$ .
Knowing that $a\mid b$ if $v_p (a) \le v_p (b)$ , we have that :
\[n \cdot v_p (n!) \le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!)\] and we must find all n for which this is true.
If we plug in $n=p$ , by Legendre's we get two equations:
\[v_p ((n^2 -1)!) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty  \lfloor \frac {n^2 -1}{p^i} \rfloor = (p-1)+0+...+0 = p-1\]
And we also get :
\[v_p ((n!)^n) = n \cdot v_p (n!)= n \cdot \sum_{i=1}^\infty   \lfloor \frac {n}{p^i} \rfloor = p \cdot ( 1+0+...0) = p\]
But we are asked to prove that $n \cdot v_p (n!) \le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!) \Longrightarrow p \le p-1$ which is false for all 'n' where n is prime.
Now we try the same for $n=p^2$ , where p is a prime. By Legendre we arrive at:
\[v_p ((p^4 -1)!) = p^3 + p^2 + p -3\]
(as $v_p(p^4!) = p^3 + p^2 + p + 1$ and $p^4$ contains 4 factors of $p$ ) and
\[p^2 \cdot v_p (p^2 !) = p^3 + p^2\]
Then we get:
\[p^2 \cdot v_p (p!) \le v_p ((n^4 -1)!) \Longrightarrow p^3 + p^2 \le p^3 + p^2 + p -3\] Which is true for all primes except for 2, so $2^2 = 4$ doesn't work. It can easily be verified that for all $n=p^i$ where $i$ is an integer greater than 2, satisfies the inequality : \[n \cdot v_p (n!) \le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!).\]
Therefore, there are 16 values that don't work and $50-16 = \boxed{34}$ values that work."

Let's implement this in Python using sympy",Notice all $15$ primes don't work as there are $n$ factors of $n$ in the denominator and $n-1$ factors of $n$ in the numerator. Further experimentation finds that $n=4$ does not work as there are 11 factors of 2 in the numerator and 12 in the denominator. We also find that it seems that all other values of $n$ work. So we get $50-15-1=\boxed{34}$ and that happens to be right.
"Consider the statement, ""If $n$ is not prime, then $n-2$ is prime."" Which of the following values of $n$ is a counterexample to this statement?

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given values of \( n \) is a counterexample to the statement ""If \( n \) is not prime, then \( n-2 \) is prime.""

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Identify which of the given values of \( n \) are not prime.
2. For each non-prime \( n \), check if \( n-2 \) is prime.
3. Identify the value of \( n \) for which \( n \) is not prime and \( n-2 \) is also not prime (i.e., a counterexample to the statement).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check for primality.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Given values of n
values_of_n = [11, 15, 19, 21, 27]

# Function to check for counterexample
def find_counterexample(values_of_n):
    for n in values_of_n:
        # Check if n is not prime
        if not sp.isprime(n):
            # Check if n-2 is prime
            if not sp.isprime(n-2):
                return n
    return None

counterexample = find_counterexample(values_of_n)
print(counterexample)
```
```output
27
```
The value of \( n \) that is a counterexample to the statement ""If \( n \) is not prime, then \( n-2 \) is prime"" is \(\boxed{27}\).
","Since a counterexample must be a value of $n$ which is not prime, $n$ must be composite, so we eliminate $\text{A}$ and $\text{C}$ . Now we subtract $2$ from the remaining answer choices, and we see that the only time $n-2$ is not prime is when $n = \boxed{27}$"

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) be the number of seniors.
- Let \( N \) be the number of non-seniors.
- We know that \( S + N = 500 \) (total number of students).

Given percentages:
- \( 40\% \) of the seniors play a musical instrument, so \( 60\% \) of the seniors do not play a musical instrument.
- \( 30\% \) of the non-seniors do not play a musical instrument, so \( 70\% \) of the non-seniors play a musical instrument.
- \( 46.8\% \) of the total students do not play a musical instrument.

1. \( 0.60S + 0.30N = 0.468 \times 500 \) (total number of students who do not play a musical instrument).
2. \( S + N = 500 \) (total number of students).

\[\frac{3}{5}x + 150 - \frac{3}{10}x = 234\] \[\frac{3}{10}x = 84\] \[x = 84\cdot\frac{10}{3} = 280\]

### Solution: To solve the given problem, we need to find the positive integer \( n \) such that:

\[
(n+1)! + (n+2)! = n! \cdot 440
\]

First, let's simplify the equation. Recall that \( (n+2)! = (n+2)(n+1)! \). Using this, we can rewrite the left-hand side:

\[
(n+1)! + (n+2)(n+1)! = (n+1)!(1 + (n+2)) = (n+1)!(n+3)
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
(n+1)!(n+3) = 440n!
\]

We can divide both sides by \( n! \):

\[
(n+1)(n+3) = 440
\]

This simplifies to a quadratic equation:

\[
n^2 + 4n + 3 = 440
\]

\[
n^2 + 4n + 3 - 440 = 0
\]

\[
n^2 + 4n - 437 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -437 \). Let's calculate the roots using Python.
```python
import math

# Coefficients of the quadratic equation
a = 1
b = 4
c = -437

# Calculate the discriminant
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Calculate the two roots
","\[\begin{split}& (n+1)n! + (n+2)(n+1)n! = 440 \cdot n! \\ \Rightarrow \ &n![n+1 + (n+2)(n+1)] = 440 \cdot n! \\ \Rightarrow \ &n + 1 + n^2 + 3n + 2 = 440 \\ \Rightarrow \ &n^2 + 4n - 437 = 0\end{split}\]
Solving by the quadratic formula, $n = \frac{-4\pm \sqrt{16+437\cdot4}}{2} = \frac{-4\pm 42}{2} = \frac{38}{2} = 19$ (since clearly $n \geq 0$ ). The answer is therefore $1 + 9 = \boxed{10}$"

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The distance between \( A \) and \( B \) is \( AB = 10 \) units.
   - Let \( AC = x \) and \( BC = y \). The perimeter condition gives us \( x + y + 10 = 50 \), which simplifies to \( x + y = 40 \).

2. **Area Condition:**
   - The area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be calculated using Heron's formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
     \]
     where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \).
   - In our case, \( a = 10 \), \( b = x \), and \( c = y \). Thus, \( s = \frac{10 + x + y}{2} = \frac{10 + 40}{2} = 25 \).
   - The area condition gives us:
     \[
     100 = \sqrt{25(25 - 10)(25 - x)(25 - y)}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     100 = \sqrt{25 \cdot 15 \cdot (25 - x) \","Notice that whatever point we pick for $C$ $AB$ will be the base of the triangle. Without loss of generality, let points $A$ and $B$ be $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$ , since for any other combination of points, we can just rotate the plane to make them $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$ under a new coordinate system. When we pick point $C$ , we have to make sure that its $y$ -coordinate is $\pm20$ , because that's the only way the area of the triangle can be $100$
Now when the perimeter is minimized, by symmetry, we put $C$ in the middle, at $(5, 20)$ . We can easily see that $AC$ and $BC$ will both be $\sqrt{20^2+5^2} = \sqrt{425}$ . The perimeter of this minimal triangle is $2\sqrt{425} + 10$ , which is larger than $50$ . Since the minimum perimeter is greater than $50$ , there is no triangle that satisfies the condition, giving us $\boxed{0}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blue and green marbles in each jar and then find the difference in the number of blue marbles between the two jars.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( B1 \) and \( G1 \) be the number of blue and green marbles in Jar 1, respectively.
   Let \( B2 \) and \( G2 \) be the number of blue and green marbles in Jar 2, respectively.

2. **Set Up Ratios:**
   From the problem statement, we have the following ratios:
   - For Jar 1: \( \frac{B1}{G1} = \frac{9}{1} \)
   - For Jar 2: \( \frac{B2}{G2} = \frac{8}{1} \)

3. **Express in Terms of Variables:**
   - For Jar 1: \( B1 = 9G1 \)
   - For Jar 2: \( B2 = 8G2 \)

4. **Total Green Marbles:**
   We know that the total number of green marbles in both jars is 95:
   \[ G1 + G2 = 95 \]

5. **Equal Number of Marbles in Each Jar:**
   Since each jar contains the same number of marbles, we have:
   \[ B1 + G1 = B2 + G2 \]

6. **Substitute Expressions:**
   Substitute \( B1 = 9G1 \) and \( B2 = 8G2","Call the number of marbles in each jar $x$ (because the problem specifies that they each contain the same number). Thus, $\frac{x}{10}$ is the number of green marbles in Jar $1$ , and $\frac{x}{9}$ is the number of green marbles in Jar $2$ . Since $\frac{x}{9}+\frac{x}{10}=\frac{19x}{90}$ , we have $\frac{19x}{90}=95$ , so there are $x=450$ marbles in each jar.
Because $\frac{9x}{10}$ is the number of blue marbles in Jar $1$ , and $\frac{8x}{9}$ is the number of blue marbles in Jar $2$ , there are $\frac{9x}{10}-\frac{8x}{9}=\frac{x}{90} = 5$ more marbles in Jar $1$ than Jar $2$ . This means the answer is $\boxed{5}$"

Since $b_1 = 9g_1$ and $b_2 = 8g_2$ , we substitute that in to obtain $10g_1 = 9g_2$ . 
Coupled with our third equation, we find that $g_1 = 45$ , and that $g_2 = 50$ . We now use this information to find $b_1 = 405$ and $b_2 = 400$

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( x \) such that the median of the numbers \( 4, 6, 8, 17, \) and \( x \) is equal to the mean of those five numbers.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the Mean:**
   The mean of the five numbers \( 4, 6, 8, 17, \) and \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{4 + 6 + 8 + 17 + x}{5} = \frac{35 + x}{5}
   \]

2. **Determine the Median:**
   The median of a set of five numbers is the third number when they are sorted in increasing order. Therefore, we need to sort the numbers \( 4, 6, 8, 17, \) and \( x \) and find the middle value.

3. **Equate the Median to the Mean:**
   For the median to be equal to the mean, the third number in the sorted list of \( 4, 6, 8, 17, \) and \( x \) must be \( \frac{35 + x}{5} \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the value of \( x \).

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable x
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Calculate the mean
mean = (4 + 6 + 8 + 17 + x) / 5

# Determine the median
# We need to consider different cases for x and find the appropriate median
cases = [
    (x < 4, [x, 4, 6,","The mean is $\frac{4+6+8+17+x}{5}=\frac{35+x}{5}$
There are three possibilities for the median: it is either $6$ $8$ , or $x$
Let's start with $6$
$\frac{35+x}{5}=6$ has solution $x=-5$ , and the sequence is $-5, 4, 6, 8, 17$ , which does have median $6$ , so this is a valid solution.
Now let the median be $8$
$\frac{35+x}{5}=8$ gives $x=5$ , so the sequence is $4, 5, 6, 8, 17$ , which has median $6$ , so this is not valid.
Finally we let the median be $x$
$\frac{35+x}{5}=x \implies 35+x=5x \implies x=\frac{35}{4}=8.75$ , and the sequence is $4, 6, 8, 8.75, 17$ , which has median $8$ . This case is therefore again not valid.
Hence the only possible value of $x$ is $\boxed{5}.$"

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. Calculate \(19!\) and convert it to its base-10 representation.
2. Compare the digits of \(19!\) to the given representation to find \(T\), \(M\), and \(H\).

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding how many numbers are the product of two distinct elements of the set \( S \) of all positive integer divisors of \( 100,000 \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find all positive integer divisors of \( 100,000 \).**
2. **Generate all possible products of two distinct elements from this set.**
3. **Count the number of unique products.**

Let's break it down step-by-step and implement it in Python using sympy.

### Step 1: Find all positive integer divisors of \( 100,000 \)

First, we need to find the divisors of \( 100,000 \). We can do this by factorizing \( 100,000 \) and generating all possible products of its factors.

### Step 2: Generate all possible products of two distinct elements

For each pair of distinct divisors, calculate their product.

### Step 3: Count the number of unique products

Finally, we count the number of unique products obtained in step 2.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Find all positive integer divisors of 100,000
n = 100000
divisors = sp.divisors(n)

# Step 2: Generate all possible products of two distinct elements
products = set()
for i in range(len(divisors)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(divisors)):
        product = divisors[i] * divisors[j]
        products.add(product)

# Step 3: Count the number of unique products
num_products = len(products)
print(num_products)
```","The prime factorization of $100,000$ is $2^5 \cdot 5^5$ . Thus, we choose two numbers $2^a5^b$ and $2^c5^d$ where $0 \le a,b,c,d \le 5$ and $(a,b) \neq (c,d)$ , whose product is $2^{a+c}5^{b+d}$ , where $0 \le a+c \le 10$ and $0 \le b+d \le 10$
Notice that this is similar to choosing a divisor of $100,000^2 = 2^{10}5^{10}$ , which has $(10+1)(10+1) = 121$ divisors. However, some of the divisors of $2^{10}5^{10}$ cannot be written as a product of two distinct divisors of $2^5 \cdot 5^5$ , namely: $1 = 2^05^0$ $2^{10}5^{10}$ $2^{10}$ , and $5^{10}$ . The last two cannot be written because the maximum factor of $100,000$ containing only $2$ s or $5$ s (and not both) is only $2^5$ or $5^5$ . Since the factors chosen must be distinct, the last two numbers cannot be so written because they would require $2^5 \cdot 2^5$ or $5^5 \cdot 5^5$ . The first two would require $1 \cdot 1$ and $2^{5}5^{5} \cdot 2^{5}5^{5}$ , respectively. This gives $121-4 = 117$ candidate numbers. It is not too hard to show that every number of the form $2^p5^q$ , where $0 \le p, q \le 10$ , and $p,q$ are not both $0$ or $10$ , can be written as a product of two distinct elements in $S$ . Hence the answer is $\boxed{117}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the area of the region inside the circle but outside the three semic","Divide the circle into four parts: the top semicircle by connecting E, F, and G( $A$ ); the bottom sector ( $B$ ), whose arc angle is $120^{\circ}$ because the large circle's radius is $2$ and the short length (the radius of the smaller semicircles) is $1$ , giving a $30^{\circ}-60^{\circ}-90^{\circ}$ triangle; the triangle formed by the radii of $A$ and the chord ( $C$ ); and the four parts which are the corners of a circle inscribed in a square ( $D$ ). Then the area is $A + B - C + D$ (in $B-C$ , we find the area of the bottom shaded region, and in $D$ we find the area of the shaded region above the semicircles but below the diameter).
The area of $A$ is $\frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 2^2 = 2\pi$
The area of $B$ is $\frac{120^{\circ}}{360^{\circ}} \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{4\pi}{3}$
For the area of $C$ , the radius of $2$ , and the distance of $1$ (the smaller semicircles' radius) to $BC$ , creates two $30^{\circ}-60^{\circ}-90^{\circ}$ triangles, so $C$ 's area is $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}$
The area of $D$ is $4 \cdot 1-\frac{1}{4}\pi \cdot 2^2=4-\pi$

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the area of the region inside the circle but outside the three semic","First we have to solve the area of the non-shaded area(the semicircles) that are in Circle $F$ .The middle semicircle has area $\frac12\pi$ and the other two have about half of their are inside the circle = $\frac14\pi\ + \frac14\pi\ + \frac12\pi\ = \pi$ . Then we subtract the part of the quartercircle that isn't in Circle $F$ . This is an area equal to that of a triangle minus an minor segment. The height of the triangle is the radius of the semicircles, which is $1$ . The length is the radius of Circle $F$ minus the length from the center of the middle semicircle up to until it is on the edge of the circle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem we can figure out that the length is: \[\sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = \sqrt{3}.\] This means that the length of the triangle is $2 - \sqrt{3}$ and so the area of the triangle is $\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2}$ . For the area of the segment, it's the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle. The triangle's length is the radius of $F$ $2$ , while its height is the radius of the semicircles: $1$ , so the area is 1. The  angle is $30^{\circ}$ as the hypotenuse is the radius of $F$ and the opposite side is the radius of the semicircles, which means the area is $\frac{1}{12}$ of the whole area, which is $4\pi$ so the area of the sector is $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and the area of the segment is $\frac{\pi}{3} - 1$ and so the area of the part of the quartercircles that stick out of Circle $F$ is: \[(\frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2})-(\frac{\pi}{3} - 1) = \frac{2 - \sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 - \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{4 - \sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\pi}{3}.\]
Since there are two, one for each side, we have to multiply it by 2, so we have ${4 - \sqrt{3}} - \frac{2\pi}{3}$ , which we subtract from $\pi$ which gets us $\frac{5\pi}{3} - 4 + \sqrt{3}$ which we subtract from $4\pi$ $=$ $\frac{12\pi}{3}$ , which is $\frac{7\pi}{3} + 4 - \sqrt{3}$ so we get $7+3+4+3=\boxed{17}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to recursively compute the sequence \( x_n \) until \( x_m \leq 4 + \frac{1}{2^{20}} \). We will then determine the smallest \( m \) for which this condition holds and find the interval in which \( m \) lies.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Initialize the sequence:** Start with \( x_0 = 5 \).
2. **Define the recursive relation:** Use the given recursive formula \( x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4}{x_n + 6} \).
3. **Iterate until the condition is met:** Compute subsequent terms and check if \( x_m \leq 4 + \frac{1}{2^{20}} \).
4. **Determine the interval:** Once \( m \) is found, identify the interval in which \( m \) lies.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accurate computation.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the initial value and the target value
x_0 = 5
target = 4 + 1 / (2 ** 20)

# Define the recursive function
def next_x(x_n):
    return (x_n**2 + 5*x_n + 4) / (x_n + 6)

# Initialize the first term
x_n = x_0
n","We first prove that $x_n > 4$ for all $n \ge 0$ , by induction. Observe that \[x_{n+1} - 4 = \frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4 - 4(x_n+6)}{x_n+6} = \frac{(x_n - 4)(x_n+5)}{x_n+6}.\] so (since $x_n$ is clearly positive for all $n$ , from the initial definition), $x_{n+1} > 4$ if and only if $x_{n} > 4$
We similarly prove that $x_n$ is decreasing: \[x_{n+1} - x_n = \frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4 - x_n(x_n+6)}{x_n+6} = \frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6} < 0.\]
Now we need to estimate the value of $x_{n+1}-4$ , which we can do using the rearranged equation: \[x_{n+1} - 4 = (x_n-4)\cdot\frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6}.\] Since $x_n$ is decreasing, $\frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6}$ is also decreasing, so we have \[\frac{9}{10} < \frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6} \le \frac{10}{11}\] and \[\frac{9}{10}(x_n-4) < x_{n+1} - 4 \le \frac{10}{11}(x_n-4).\]
This becomes \[\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^n = \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^n \left(x_0-4\right) < x_{n} - 4 \le \left(\frac{10}{11}\right)^n \left(x_0-4\right) = \left(\frac{10}{11}\right)^n.\] The problem thus reduces to finding the least value of $n$ such that \[\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^n < x_{n} - 4 \le \frac{1}{2^{20}} \text{  and  }  \left(\frac{10}{11}\right)^{n-1} > x_{n-1} - 4 > \frac{1}{2^{20}}.\]
Taking logarithms, we get $n \ln \frac{9}{10} < -20 \ln 2$ and $(n-1)\ln \frac{10}{11} > -20 \ln 2$ , i.e.
\[n > \frac{20\ln 2}{\ln\frac{10}{9}} \text{  and  }  n-1 < \frac{20\ln 2}{\ln\frac{11}{10}} .\]
As approximations, we can use $\ln\frac{10}{9} \approx \frac{1}{9}$ $\ln\frac{11}{10} \approx \frac{1}{10}$ , and $\ln 2\approx 0.7$ . These approximations allow us to estimate \[126 < n < 141,\] which gives $\boxed{81,242}$"

$x_{n+1}=\dfrac{(x_n + 4)(x_n + 1)}{x_n + 6} \Rightarrow y_{n+1}+4=\dfrac{(y_n+8)(y_n+5)}{y_n+10}$
$y_{n+1}+4=\dfrac{y_n^2+13y_n+40}{y_n+10} = \dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n +(4y_n+40)}{y_n+10}$
$y_{n+1}+4=\dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n}{y_n+10} + 4$
$y_{n+1}=\dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n}{y_n+10}$
Using wishful thinking, we can simplify the recursion as follows:
$y_{n+1} = \frac{y_n^2 + 9y_n + y_n - y_n}{y_n + 10}$
$y_{n+1} = \frac{y_n(y_n + 10) - y_n}{y_n + 10}$
$y_{n+1} = y_n - \frac{y_n}{y_n + 10}$
$y_{n+1} = y_n\left(1 - \frac{1}{y_n + 10}\right)$
The recursion looks like a geometric sequence with the ratio changing slightly after each term. Notice from the recursion that the $y_n$ sequence is strictly decreasing, so all the terms after $y_0$ will be less than 1. Also, notice that all the terms in sequence will be positive. Both of these can be proven by induction.
With both of those observations in mind, $\frac{9}{10} < 1 - \frac{1}{y_n + 10} \leq \frac{10}{11}$ . Combining this with the fact that the recursion resembles a geometric sequence, we conclude that $\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^n < y_n \leq \left(\frac{10}{11}\right)^n.$
$\frac{9}{10}$ is approximately equal to $\frac{10}{11}$ and the ranges that the answer choices give us are generous, so we should use either $\frac{9}{10}$ or $\frac{10}{11}$ to find a rough estimate for $m$
Since $\dfrac{1}{2}=0.5$ , that means $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=2^{-\frac{1}{2}} \approx 0.7$ . Additionally, $\left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^3=0.729$
Therefore, we can estimate that $2^{-\frac{1}{2}} < y_3$
Raising both sides to the 40th power, we get $2^{-20} < (y_3)^{40}$
But $y_3 = (y_0)^3$ , so $2^{-20} < (y_0)^{120}$ and therefore, $2^{-20} < y_{120}$
This tells us that $m$ is somewhere around 120, so our answer is $\boxed{81,242}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to recursively compute the sequence \( x_n \) until \( x_m \leq 4 + \frac{1}{2^{20}} \). We will then determine the smallest \( m \) for which this condition holds and find the interval in which \( m \) lies.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Initialize the sequence:** Start with \( x_0 = 5 \).
2. **Define the recursive relation:** Use the given recursive formula \( x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4}{x_n + 6} \).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accurate computation.

```python

# Define the initial value and the target value
x_0 = 5
target = 4 + 1 / (2 ** 20)

# Define the recursive function

    return (x_n**2 + 5*x_n + 4) / (x_n + 6)

# Initialize the first term
x_n = x_0
n","Since the choices are rather wide ranges, we can use approximation to make it easier. Notice that \[x_{n+1} - x_n = \frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6}\] And $x_0 =5$ , we know that $x_n$ is a declining sequence, and as it get close to 4 its decline will slow, never falling below 4. So we'll use 4 to approximate $x_n$ in the denominator so that we have a solvable difference equation: \[x_{n+1} - x_n = \frac{4-x_n}{10}\] \[x_{n+1} = \frac{9}{10}x_n + \frac{2}{5}\] Solve it with $x_0 = 5$ , we have \[x_n = 4 + (\frac{9}{10})^n\] Now we wish to find $n$ so that \[(\frac{9}{10})^n \approx \frac{1}{2^{20}}\] \[n \approx \frac{\log{2^{20}}}{\log{10}-\log9} \approx \frac{20*0.3}{0.05} = 120\] Since 120 is safely within the range of [81,242], we have the answer. $\boxed{81,242}$"

n","We start by simplifying the recursion: $x_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6}$ .
While $x_n > 4$ $x_n$ is a decreasing sequence. Let $x_n = 4 + f_n$ . Then \[x_{n} - x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n-4}{x_n+6} = \frac{f_n}{10 + f_n} \approx \frac{f_n}{10}.\] Now notice that we want to find $m$ , such that $x_m \leq 4 + \frac{1}{2^{20}}$ , and $x_0 = 4 + \frac{1}{2^0}$ . 
We are going to find an approximate number of steps to go from $4 + \frac{1}{2^i}$ to $4 + \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ . 
If $x_j = 4 + \frac{1}{2^i}$ , then $f_j = \frac{1}{2^i}$ and if $x_k = 4 + \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ , then $f_k = \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ . Then \[x_j - x_k = \frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \approx \frac{f_j}{10} + \frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \frac{f_{k-1}}{10}.\] Furthermore, \[\frac{1}{2^i} = f_j > f_{j+1} > f_{j+2} > ... > f_{k-1} > f_k = \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}.\] Therefore, \[(k-j) \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{2^i}}{10} > \frac{f_j}{10} + \frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \frac{f_{k-1}}{10} > (k-j) \cdot \frac{\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}}{10},\] so $5 < k-j < 10$ . Therefore, to go from $f_0 = \frac{1}{2^0}$ to $f_m = \frac{1}{2^{20}}$ , we will need to do this 20 times, which means $100 < m - 0 < 200$ , which is within the range of [81,242], so we have the answer. $\boxed{81,242}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of sequences of length 19 that start with a `0`, end with a `0`, contain no two consecutive `0`s, and contain no three consecutive `1`s.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the constraints:**
   - The sequence starts with `0`.
   - The sequence ends with `0`.
   - No two consecutive `0`s.
   - No three consecutive `1`s.

2. **Formulate the problem:**
   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define:
   - \(a_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `0`.
   - \(b_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `10`.
   - \(c_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `110`.

3. **Establish recurrence relations:**
   - \(a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}\)
   - \(b_n = a_{n-1}\)
   - \(c_n = b_{n-1}\)

   These relations hold because:
   - A sequence ending with `0` can come from any sequence ending with `0`, `10`, or `110` (after appending a `0`).
   - A sequence ending with `10` can only come from a sequence ending with `0` (after appending `10`).
   - A sequence ending with `110` can only come from a sequence ending with `10` (after appending `110`).","Let $f(n)$ be the number of valid sequences of length $n$ (satisfying the conditions given in the problem).
We know our valid sequence must end in a $0$ . Then, since we cannot have two consecutive $0$ s, it must end in a $10$ . Now, we only have two cases: it ends with $010$ , or it ends with $110$ which is equivalent to $0110$ . Thus, our sequence must be of the forms $0\ldots010$ or $0\ldots0110$ . In the first case, the first $n-2$ digits are equivalent to a valid sequence of length $n-2$ . In the second, the first $n-3$ digits are equivalent to a valid sequence of length $n-3$ . Therefore, it must be the case that $f(n) = f(n-3) + f(n-2)$ , with $n \ge 3$ (because otherwise, the sequence would contain only 0s and this is not allowed due to the given conditions).
It is easy to find $f(3) = 1$ since the only possible valid sequence is $010$ $f(4)=1$ since the only possible valid sequence is $0110$ $f(5)=1$ since the only possible valid sequence is $01010$
The recursive sequence is then as follows:
\[f(3)=1\] \[f(4)=1\] \[f(5) = 1\] \[f(6) = 1 + 1 = 2\] \[f(7) = 1 + 1 = 2\] \[f(8) = 1 + 2 = 3\] \[f(9) = 2 + 2 = 4\] \[f(10) = 2 + 3 = 5\] \[f(11) = 3 + 4 = 7\] \[f(12) = 4 + 5 = 9\] \[f(13) = 5 + 7 = 12\] \[f(14) = 7 + 9 = 16\] \[f(15) = 9 + 12 = 21\] \[f(16) = 12 + 16 = 28\] \[f(17) = 16 + 21 = 37\] \[f(18) = 21 + 28 = 49\] \[f(19) = 28 + 37 = 65\]
So, our answer is $\boxed{65}$"

Case 1 : nine $2$ s - there is only $1$ way to arrange them.
Case 2 : two $3$ s and six $2$ s - there are ${8\choose2} = 28$ ways to arrange them.

Now, we note that there cannot be only one block of $11$ in the entire sequence, as there must be zeroes at both ends and if we only include 1 block, of $11$ s this cannot be satisfied. This is true for all odd numbers of $11$ blocks.
Case 2 : There are 2 $11$ blocks. Using the zeroes in the sequence as dividers, we have a sample as $0110110101010101010$ . We know there are 8 places for $11$ s, which will be filled by $1$ s if the $11$ s don't fill them. This is ${8\choose2} = 28$ ways.
Case 3 : Four $11$ blocks arranged. Using the same logic as Case 2, we have ${7\choose4} = 35$ ways to arrange four $11$ blocks.
Case 4 : No single $1$ blocks, only $11$ blocks. There is simply one case for this, which is $0110110110110110110$

We can then think of constructing a sequence as adding groups of terms to this $0$ , each ending in $0$ . (This is always possible because every valid string ends in $0$ .) For example, we can represent the string $01011010110110$ as: $0-10-110-10-110-110$ .
To not have any consecutive 0s, we must have at least one $1$ before the next $0$ . However, we cannot have three or more $1$ s before the next $0$ because we cannot have three consecutive $1$ s. Consequently, we can only have one or two $1$ s.
So we can have the groups: $10$ and $110$
After the initial $0$ , we have $18$ digits left to fill in the string. Let the number of $10$ blocks be $x$ , and $110$ be $y$ . Then $x$ and $y$ must satisfy $2x+3y=18$ . We recognize this as a Diophantine equation. Taking $\pmod{2}$ yields $y=0 \pmod{2}$ . Since $x$ and $y$ must both be nonnegative, we get the solutions $(9, 0)$ $(6, 2)$ $(3, 4)$ , and $(0, 6)$ . We now handle each of these cases separately.
$(9, 0)$ : Only one arrangement, namely all $10$ s.
$(6, 2)$ : We have 6 groups of $11$ , and $2$ groups of $110$ . This has $\binom{6+2}{2}=28$ cases.
$(3, 4)$ : This means we have 3 groups of $10$ , and 4 groups of $110$ . This has $\binom{3+4}{3}=35$ cases.
$(0, 6)$ : Only one arrangement, namely all $110$
Adding these, we have $1+28+35+1=65 \longrightarrow \boxed{65}$ .

   - \(a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}\)
   - \(b_n = a_{n-1}\)
   - \(c_n = b_{n-1}\)

   These relations hold because:
   - A sequence ending with `0` can come from any sequence ending with `0`, `10`, or `110` (after appending a `0`).
   - A sequence ending with `10` can only come from a sequence ending with `0` (after appending `10`).
   - A sequence ending with `110` can only come from a sequence ending with `10` (after appending `110`).","Suppose the number of $0$ s is $n$ . We can construct the sequence in two steps:
Step 1: put $n-1$ of $1$ s between the $0$ s;
Step 2: put the rest $19-n-(n-1)=20-2n$ of $1$ s in the $n-1$ spots where there is a $1$ . There are $\binom{n-1}{20-2n}$ ways of doing this.
Now we find the possible values of $n$
First of all $n+(n-1) \leq 19 \Rightarrow n\leq 10$ (otherwise there will be two consecutive $0$ s);
And secondly $20-2n \leq n-1\Rightarrow n\geq 7$ (otherwise there will be three consecutive $1$ s).
Therefore the answer is \[\sum_{n=7}^{10} \binom{n-1}{20-2n} = \binom{6}{6} + \binom{7}{4} + \binom{8}{2} + \binom{9}{0} = \boxed{65}.\]"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of sequences of length 19 that start with a `0`, end with a `0`, contain no two consecutive `0`s, and contain no three consecutive `1`s.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the constraints:**
   - The sequence starts with `0`.
   - The sequence ends with `0`.
   - No two consecutive `0`s.
   - No three consecutive `1`s.

2. **Formulate the problem:**
   We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's define:
   - \(a_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `0`.
   - \(b_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `10`.
   - \(c_n\): the number of valid sequences of length \(n\) that end with `110`.

3. **Establish recurrence relations:**
   - \(a_n = a_{n-1} + b_{n-1} + c_{n-1}\)
   - \(b_n = a_{n-1}\)
   - \(c_n = b_{n-1}\)

   These relations hold because:
   - A sequence ending with `0` can come from any sequence ending with `0`, `10`, or `110` (after appending a `0`).
   - A sequence ending with `10` can only come from a sequence ending with `0` (after appending `10`).
   - A sequence ending with `110` can only come from a sequence ending with `10` (after appending `110`).","For a valid sequence of length $n$ , the sequence must be in the form of $01xx...xx10$ . By removing the $01$ at the start of the sequence and the $10$ at the end of the sequence, there are $n-4$ bits left. The $n-4$ bits left can be in the form of:

### Solution: To determine the day when Yasin's unit of blood expires, we need to calculate the number of seconds before expiration and then convert this time into days.

Given:
- \(10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\)
- Yasin donates blood on noon of January 1.

Steps:
1. Calculate \(10!\).
2. Convert the number of seconds in \(10!\) into days.
3. Add this duration to January 1, 2022, to find the expiration date.

Let's start by calculating \(10!\):

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

Next, we need to convert this number of seconds into days. There are 86,400 seconds in a day.

Finally, we will add the number of days to January 1, 2022.

Let's perform these calculations using Python.
```python
import math
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Calculate 10!
factorial_10 = math.factorial(10)

# Convert seconds to days
seconds_in_day = 86400
days_to_expire = factorial_10 // seconds_in_day

# Yasin donated blood on January 1, 2022
donation_date = datetime(2022, 1","There are $60 \cdot 60 \cdot 24 = 86400$ seconds in a day, which means that Yasin's blood expires in $10! \div 86400 = 42$ days. Since there are $31$ days in January (consult a calendar), then $42-31+1$ (Jan 1 doesn't count) is $12$ days into February, so $\boxed{12}$"

2. **Ensure Non-Consecutiveness:**

Case 1: Consider two consecutive periods as a ""block"" of which there are 5 places to put in(1,2; 2,3; 3,4; 4,5; 5,6). Then we simply need to place two classes within the block, $3 \cdot 2$ . Finally we have 4 periods remaining to place the final math class. Thus there are $5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 4$ ways to place two consecutive math classes with disregard to the third.
Case 2: Now consider three consecutive periods as a ""block"" of which there are now 4 places to put in(1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5; 4,5,6).

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the set of all possible values for \(d\), the distance to the nearest town, given that all three statements made by Alice, Bob, and Charlie are false.

Let's analyze each statement:

1. Alice's statement: ""We are at least 6 miles away"" is false. This means \(d < 6\).
2. Bob's statement: ""We are at most 5 miles away"" is false. This means \(d > 5\).
3. Charlie's statement: ""The nearest town is at most 4 miles away"" is false. This means \(d > 4\).

Since all three statements are false, we need to find the interval for \(d\) that satisfies:

2. \(d > 5\)
3. \(d > 4\) (which is already covered by \(d > 5\))

### Solution: To solve this problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

1. Let \( L \) be the number of like votes.
2. Let \( D \) be the number of dislike votes.
3. The total number of votes \( V \) is \( L + D \).
4. The score \( S \) is given by \( S = L - D \).
5. It is given that \( 65\% \) of the votes are likes, so \( L = 0.65V \).
6. The score \( S \) is \( 90 \), so \( L - D = 90 \).

Using these equations, we can solve for \( V \).

First, express \( D \) in terms of \( V \):
\[ D = V - L \]

Since \( L = 0.65V \), we have:
\[ D = V - 0.65V = 0.35V \]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) in the score equation:
\[ L - D = 90 \]
\[ 0.65V - 0.35V = 90 \]
\[ 0.3V = 90 \]
\[ V = \frac{90}{0.3} \]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.

### Solution: To determine how many integer values of \( n \) make \( 4000 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^n \) an integer, we need to analyze the expression and its constraints.

1. **Expression Analysis:**
   \[
   4000 \cdot \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^n = 4000 \cdot 2^n \cdot 5^{-n}
   \]
   For this expression to be an integer, the factor \( 5^{-n} \) must cancel out with the factor of \( 5 \) in \( 4000 \).

2. **Prime Factorization of 4000:**
   \[
   4000 = 2^5 \cdot 5^3
   \]
   This means that there are 3 factors of 5 in 4000.

3. **Constraints on \( n \):**
   - When \( n \geq 0 \), \( 5^{-n} \) introduces a factor of \( 5^{-n} \). To cancel out the \( 5^3 \) in 4000, we need \( n \leq 3 \).
   - When \( n < 0 \), \( 2^n \) introduces a factor of \( 2^{-|n|} \). To cancel out the \( 2^5 \) in 4000, we need \( -|n| \leq 5 \) or \( n \geq -5 \).

Combining these constraints, \( n \) must satisfy:
\[
-5 \leq n \leq 3
\]

4. **Counting Integer Values:**
   We need to count all integer values of \( n \) within this range.

Let's implement this in Python to count the number of integer values of \( n \) that satisfy the constraints.

```","Note that \[4000\cdot \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^n=\left(2^5\cdot5^3\right)\cdot \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^n=2^{5+n}\cdot5^{3-n}.\] Since this expression is an integer, we need:

So we can proceed to divide $4000$ by $5^n$ for each increasing positive value of $n$ until we get a non-factor of $4000$ and also divide $4000$ by $2^{-n}$ for each decreasing negative value of $n$ . For positive values we get $n= 1, 2, 3$ and for negative values we get $n= -1, -2, -3, -4, -5$ .

3. Let \( z \) be the number of 25-cent coins.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- Joe has 3 more 10-cent coins than 5-cent coins: \( y = x + 3 \)
- Joe has a total of 23 coins: \( x + y + z = 23 \)
- The total value of the coins is 320 cents: \( 5x + 10y + 25z = 320 \)

# Define the equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = y - (x + 3)  # y = x + 3
eq2 = x + y + z - 23  # x + y + z = 23
eq3 = 5*x + 10*y + 25*z - 320  # 5x + 10y + 25z","Let $x$ be the number of $5$ -cent coins that Joe has. Therefore, he must have $(x+3) \ 10$ -cent coins and $(23-(x+3)-x) \ 25$ -cent coins.

- The total value of the coins is 320 cents: \( 5x + 10y + 25z = 320 \)

We need to find how many more 25-cent coins Joe has than 5-cent coins, i.e., find \( z - x \).

Let's set up and solve these equations using Python and SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')

# Define the equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = y - (x + 3)  # y = x + 3
eq2 = x + y + z - 23  # x + y + z = 23
eq3 = 5*x + 10*y + 25*z - 320  # 5x + 10y + 25z","Let the number of $5$ -cent coins be $x,$ the number of $10$ -cent coins be $x+3,$ and the number of $25$ -cent coins be $y.$
Set up the following two equations with the information given in the problem: \[5x+10(x+3)+25y=320 \Rightarrow 15x+25y+30=320 \Rightarrow 15x+25y=290\] \[x+x+3+y=23 \Rightarrow 2x+3+y=23 \Rightarrow 2x+y=20\]
From there, multiply the second equation by $25$ to get \[50x+25y=500.\]
Subtract the first equation from the multiplied second equation to get $35x=210,$ or $x=6.$
Substitute $6$ in for $x$ into one of the equations to get $y=8.$
Finally, the answer is $8-6=\boxed{2}.$"

Let $h$ be the height of the top triangle. We can set up a height-to-base similarity ratio, using the top triangle and $\triangle{ADE}$ . The top triangle has a base of $3\cdot{2}=6$ , and $DE=4\cdot{2}=8.$ The height of $\triangle{ADE}$ is $h+1$ , therefore our ratio is $\frac{h}{6}=\frac{h+1}{8}$ , which yields $h=3$ as our answer.
To find the area of the trapezoid, we can take the area of $\triangle{ABC}$ and subtract the area of $\triangle{ADE},$ whose base is $8$ and height $3+1=4$ . It follows that the area of $\triangle{ADE}=16$ , and subtracting this from $40$ gives us $40-16=\boxed{24}$"

   The number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation \( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 10 \) can be found using the stars and bars theorem, which states that the number of solutions is given by:
   \[

$\textbf{Case 1:}$ $y>1$ $3-3y$ will be negative so $|3-3y| = 3y-3.$ $|3y-3-y| = |2y-3| = 1$
$2y-3$ is positive so $2y-3 = 1$ and $y = 2$ and $x = 3-3(2) = -3$
$2y-3$ is negative so $|2y-3| = 3-2y = 1$ $2y = 2$ and so there are no solutions ( $y$ can't equal to $1$
$\textbf{Case 2:}$ $y = 1$ :
It is fairly clear that $x = 0.$
$\textbf{Case 3:}$ $y<1$ $3-3y$ will be positive so $|3-3y-y| = |3-4y| = 1$
$3-4y$ will be negative so $4y-3 = 1$ $\rightarrow$ $4y = 4$ . We already have this solution from Case 2 as $y = 1$
$3-4y$ will be positive so $3-4y = 1$ $\rightarrow$ $4y = 2$ $y = \frac{1}{2}$ and $x = \frac{3}{2}$ .
Thus, the solutions are: $(-3,2), (0,1), \left(\frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2} \right)$ , and the answer is $\boxed{3}$"

### Solution: To solve the given problem, we need to find the number of ordered pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy both equations:
\[ x + 3y = 3 \]
\[ \big||x| - |y|\big| = 1 \]

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Equations:**
   - The first equation is a linear equation representing a line in the Cartesian plane.
   - The second equation involves absolute values, which can lead to different cases.

2. **Analyze the Absolute Value Cases:**
   The equation \(\big||x| - |y|\big| = 1\) can be broken down into four cases based on the signs of \(x\) and \(y\):
   - Case 1: \( |x| - |y| = 1 \)
   - Case 2: \( |x| - |y| = -1 \)
   - Case 3: \( ||x| - |y|| = 1 \)

3. **Solve Each Case:**
   For each case, we will solve the system of equations:
   - \( x + 3y = 3 \)
   - Combined with each case of \( |x| - |y| = 1 \) and \( ||x| - |y|| = 1 \)

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the number of solutions.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

# Define the equations
eq1 = x + 3*y - 3

# Define the absolute value cases
case1 = sp.Abs(x) - sp.Abs(y) - 1
case2 = sp.Abs(x) - sp.Abs(y) +","Note that $||x| - |y||$ can take on one of four values: $x + y$ $x - y$ $-x + y$ $-x -y$ . So we have 4 cases:
Case 1: ||x| - |y|| = x+y \[x+3y=3\] \[x+y=1\]
Subtracting:
$2y=2 \Rightarrow y=1$ and $x=0$
$\text{Result: } (0,1)$
Case 2: ||x| - |y|| = x-y \[x+3y=3\] \[x-y=1\]
Subtacting:
$4y=2 \Rightarrow y=\dfrac{1}{2}$ an $x=\dfrac{3}{2}$
$\text{Result: } \left(\dfrac{3}{2},\dfrac{1}{2}\right)$
Case 3: ||x| - |y|| = -x+y \[x+3y=3\] \[-x+y=1\]
Adding:
$4y=4 \Rightarrow y=1$ and $x=0$
$\text{Result: } (0,1)$ . Since this is the same solution as we got in Case 1, we can not count this (otherwise, we would have overcounted).
Case 4: ||x| - |y|| = -x-y \[x+3y=3\] \[-x-y=1\]
Adding:
$2y=4 \Rightarrow y=2$ and $x=-3$
$\text{Result: } (-3,2)$
Answer
We solved each case by elimination (either adding the two equations or subtracting), to obtain three solutions: $(0, 1)$ $(-3,2)$ $\left(\dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{1}{2}\right)$
Our answer is $\boxed{3}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between the centers of the two smaller circles that are tangent to each other and internally tangent to the larger circle.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The larger circle has a radius of 13.
   - Each of the smaller circles has a radius of 5.
   - The smaller circles are externally tangent to each other.
   - Each smaller circle is internally tangent to the larger circle.

2. **Determine the Centers' Configuration:**
   - Let \( O \) be the center of the larger circle.
   - Let \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) be the centers of the smaller circles.
   - Since the smaller circles are externally tangent, the distance between \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).

3. **Find the Distance from \( O \) to \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \):**
   - The distance from \( O \) to \( O_1 \) and \( O_2 \) is \( 13 - 5 = 8 \).

4. **Use the Geometry to Find \( AB \):**
   - The distance \( AB","[asy] draw(circle((0,0),13)); draw(circle((5,-6.25),5)); draw(circle((-5,-6.25),5)); label(""$A$"", (-8.125,-10.15), S); label(""$B$"", (8.125,-10.15), S); draw((0,0)--(-8.125,-10.15)); draw((0,0)--(8.125,-10.15)); draw((-5,-6.25)--(5,-6.25)); draw((-8.125,-10.15)--(8.125,-10.15)); label(""$X$"", (0,0), N); label(""$Y$"", (-5,-6.25),NW); label(""$Z$"", (5,-6.25),NE); [/asy]
Let the center of the surrounding circle be $X$ . The circle that is tangent at point $A$ will have point $Y$ as the center. Similarly, the circle that is tangent at point $B$ will have point $Z$ as the center. Connect $AB$ $YZ$ $XA$ , and $XB$ . Now observe that $\triangle XYZ$ is similar to $\triangle XAB$ by SAS.
Writing out the ratios, we get \[\frac{XY}{XA}=\frac{YZ}{AB} \Rightarrow \frac{13-5}{13}=\frac{5+5}{AB} \Rightarrow \frac{8}{13}=\frac{10}{AB} \Rightarrow AB=\frac{65}{4}.\] Therefore, our answer is $65+4= \boxed{69}$"

$\textbf{(A) }5 \qquad \textbf{(B) }8 \qquad \textbf{(C) }12 \qquad \textbf{(D) }13 \qquad \textbf{(E) }15 \qquad$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how many integer-length line segments can be drawn from vertex \( B \) to a point on the hypotenuse \( \overline{AC} \) of the right triangle \( ABC \).

Given:
- \( AB = 20 \)
- \( BC = 21 \)

First, we calculate the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \) using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{20^2 + 21^2} = \sqrt{400 + 441} = \sqrt{841} = 29
\]

Next, we need to find the integer lengths of the line segments from \( B \) to any point \( D \) on \( AC \). Let's denote the distance from \( B \) to \( D \) as \( BD \).

To find the possible integer lengths of \( BD \), we need to consider the following:
- The minimum length of \( BD \) is 0 (when \( D \) coincides with \( B \)).
- The maximum length of \( BD \) is the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \), which is 29 (when \( D \) coincides with \( C \)).

We need to check all integer lengths between these two extremes.

Let's use Python and sympy to determine the number of integer lengths \( BD \) can take.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the lengths of the legs
AB = 20
BC = 21

# Calculate the hypotenuse
AC = sp.sqrt(AB**2 + BC**2)

# Calculate the number of integer lengths from B to any point on the hypotenuse

As the problem has no diagram, we draw a diagram. The hypotenuse has length $29$ . Let $P$ be the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $AC$ . Note that $BP$ is the shortest possible length of any segment. Writing the area of the triangle in two ways, we can solve for $BP=\dfrac{20\cdot  21}{29}$ , which is between $14$ and $15$
Let the line segment be $BX$ , with $X$ on $AC$ . As you move $X$ along the hypotenuse from $A$ to $P$ , the length of $BX$ strictly decreases, hitting all the integer values from $20, 19, \dots 15$ (IVT). Similarly, moving $X$ from $P$ to $C$ hits all the integer values from $15, 16, \dots, 21$ . This is a total of $\boxed{13}$ distinct line segments.

We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$ :
If $a_7 = -1$ , we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$ 's for $0 \leq i \leq 6$ . This is because even if we make all of the other $a_{i}$ equal to $1$ , we will have that our number is $(-1)(3^{7}) + (3^{6}+3^{5}+...+3^{0}) = -3^{7} + \frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1}$ . However, note that since $\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ $-3^{7} + \frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$ .
If $a_{7}=0$ , we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$ , we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$ . Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$ . Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$ , and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$ . Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.
If $a_{7}=1$ , we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$ , we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ . So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \leq i \leq 6$ , we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$ . So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.
Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$ . In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$ $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$ . We can now start building up our values for $S$ $S_{0} = 2$ $a_{0} = 0, 1$ ), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$ . So, we have $S_{7} = 2187 + 1094 = \boxed{3281}$ .

\[a_7\cdot3^7 + a_6\cdot3^6 + a_5\cdot3^5 + a_4\cdot3^4 + a_3\cdot3^3 + a_2\cdot3^2 + a_1\cdot3^1 + a_0\cdot3^0,\]

This is a form of a digital sum (or weighted sum) where each coefficient \(a_i\) is chosen from \(-1\), \(0\), or \(1\). The total number of possible combinations of \(a_i\) is \(3^8\) since each \(a_i\) has 3 possible values.

However, we are only interested in the nonnegative integers. To find the nonnegative integers, we need to exclude any negative sums.

We can approach this problem by iterating over all possible combinations of \(a_i\) and calculating the value of the expression for each combination. Then, we count the number of nonnegative integers produced.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy and itertools to generate the combinations and evaluate the expression.

```python
import itertools

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes for a \(7 \times 7\) grid, we need to consider the symmetries described in the problem: rotations by multiples of \(90^\circ\) counterclockwise and reflections across lines joining opposite corners and midpoints of opposite sides.

We can use Burnside's Lemma to count the number of distinct colorings accounting for these symmetries.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Symmetries:**
   - There are 4 rotations: \(0^\circ\), \(90^\circ\), \(180^\circ\), and \(270^\circ\).
   - There are 2 reflections: across the vertical line and across the horizontal line.

2. **Apply Burnside's Lemma:**
   - Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of colorings fixed by each symmetry.

3. **Count Colorings Fixed by Each Symmetry:**
   - **Identity (0° rotation, no change):** All \(49\) squares can be either black or white, so there are \(2^{49}\) colorings.
   - **90° and 270° rotations:** For a grid to be invariant under a \(90^\circ\) rotation, it must have a specific block structure.

Imagine folding the scanning code along its lines of symmetry. There will be $10$ regions which you have control over coloring. Since we must subtract off $2$ cases for the all-black and all-white cases, the answer is $2^{10}-2=\boxed{1022.}$"

There are $3 \times 3$ squares in the corners of this $7 \times 7$ square, and there is a horizontal and vertical stripe through the middle. Because we need to have symmetry when the diagonals and midpoints of the large square is connected, we can create a table like this: (Different letters represent different color choices between black and white)
\[\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline A & B & C \\ \hline B & D & E \\ \hline C & E & F \\ \hline \end{tabular}\] (Note that coloring one $3 \times 3$ square will also determine the colorings of the other $3$ because the large $7 \times 7$ square must look the same when it is rotated by $90^\circ$
There are $6$ different letters and $2$ choices of color (black and white) for each letter, so there are $2^6=64$ colorings of a proper $3 \times 3$ square. Now, all that's left are the horizontal and vertical stripes. Using similar logic, we can see that there are $4$ different letters, so there are $2^4=16$ different colorings. Multiplying them together gives $16 \times 64 = 1024$ . Going back to the question, we see that ""there must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares.""

We see that $x=0$ always has at least one intersection at $(0,-a)$ (and is in fact a double root).
The other two intersection points have $x$ coordinates $\pm\sqrt{2a-1}$ . We must have $2a-1> 0;$ otherwise we are in the case where the parabola lies entirely above the circle (tangent at the point $(0,a)$ ).

1. **Substitute \(y = x^2 - a\) into \(x^2 + y^2 = a^2\):**
   \[
   x^2 + (x^2 - a)^2 = a^2
   \]

2. **Simplify the resulting equation:**
   \[
   x^2 + x^4 - 2ax^2 + a^2 = a^2
   \]
   \[
   x^4 - (2a - 1)x^2 = 0
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Factor out \(x^2\):
   \[
   x^2(x^2 - (2a - 1)) = 0
   \]

   This gives us:
   \[
   x^2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2a - 1
   \]

4. **Find the corresponding \(y\) values:**
   - For \(x^2 = 0\), \(x = 0\) and substituting into \(y = x^2 - a\), we get \(y = -a\).
   - For \(x^2 = 2a - 1\), \(x = \pm \sqrt{2a - 1}\) and substituting into \(y = x^2 - a\), we get \(y","In order to solve for the values of $a$ , we need to just count multiplicities of the roots when the equations are set equal to each other: in other words, take the derivative. We know that $\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = x^2 - a$ . Now, we take square of both sides, and rearrange to obtain $x^4 - (2a - 1)x^2 = 0$ . Now, we may take the second derivative of the equation to obtain $6x^2 - (2a - 1) = 0$ . Now, we must take discriminant. Since we need the roots of that equation to be real and not repetitive (otherwise they would not intersect each other at three points), the discriminant must be greater than zero. Thus,
\[b^2 - 4ac > 0 \rightarrow 0 - 4(6)(-(2a - 1)) > 0 \rightarrow a > \frac{1}{2}\] The answer is $\boxed{12}$ and we are done."

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the values of \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) such that the given conditions are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understand the given conditions:**
   - \(\gcd(a, b) = 24\)
   - \(\gcd(b, c) = 36\)
   - \(\gcd(c, d) = 54\)
   - \(70 < \gcd(d, a) < 100\)

2. **Express the variables in terms of their prime factors:**
   - \(a = 24x\)
   - \(b = 24y\)
   - \(c = 36z\)
   - \(d = 54w\)

   Here, \(x, y, z,\) and \(w\) are integers that are coprime to the respective factors.

3. **Determine the gcd conditions in terms of \(x, y, z,\) and \(w\):**
   - \(\gcd(24x, 24y) = 24\)
   - \(\gcd(24y, 36z) = 36\)
   - \(\gcd(36z, 54w) = 54\)
   - \(70 < \gcd(54w, 24x) < 100\)

4. **Simplify the gcd conditions:**
   - Since \(\gcd(24x, 24y) = 24\), \(\gcd(x,","The GCD information tells us that $24$ divides $a$ , both $24$ and $36$ divide $b$ , both $36$ and $54$ divide $c$ , and $54$ divides $d$ . Note that we have the prime factorizations: \begin{align*} 24 &= 2^3\cdot 3,\\ 36 &= 2^2\cdot 3^2,\\ 54 &= 2\cdot 3^3. \end{align*}
Hence we have \begin{align*} a &= 2^3\cdot 3\cdot w\\ b &= 2^3\cdot 3^2\cdot x\\ c &= 2^2\cdot 3^3\cdot y\\ d &= 2\cdot 3^3\cdot z \end{align*} for some positive integers $w,x,y,z$ . Now if $3$ divides $w$ , then $\gcd(a,b)$ would be at least $2^3\cdot 3^2$ which is too large, hence $3$ does not divide $w$ . Similarly, if $2$ divides $z$ , then $\gcd(c,d)$ would be at least $2^2\cdot 3^3$ which is too large, so $2$ does not divide $z$ . Therefore, \[\gcd(a,d)=2\cdot 3\cdot \gcd(w,z)\] where neither $2$ nor $3$ divide $\gcd(w,z)$ . In other words, $\gcd(w,z)$ is divisible only by primes that are at least $5$ . The only possible value of $\gcd(a,d)$ between $70$ and $100$ and which fits this criterion is $78=2\cdot3\cdot13$ , so the answer is $\boxed{13}$"

Combining $1$ and $2$ yields $b$ has (at a minimum) $2^3 \cdot 3^2$ , and thus $a$ has $2^3 \cdot 3$ (and no more powers of $3$ because otherwise $\gcd(a,b)$ would be different). In addition, $c$ has $3^3 \cdot 2^2$ , and thus $d$ has $3^3 \cdot 2$ (similar to $a$ , we see that $d$ cannot have any other powers of $2$ ). We now assume the simplest scenario, where $a = 2^3 \cdot 3$ and $d = 3^3 \cdot 2$ . According to this base case, we have $\gcd(a, d) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$ . We want an extra factor between the two such that this number is between $70$ and $100$ , and this new factor cannot be divisible by $2$ or $3$ . Checking through, we see that $6 \cdot 13$ is the only one that works. Therefore the answer is $\boxed{13}$"

The prime factorizations are $2^3\times 3^1$ $2^2\times 3^2$ and $2^1\times 3^3$ , respectively. Now, let $a_2$ and $a_3$ be the number of times $2$ and $3$ go into $a$ , respectively. Define $b_2$ $b_3$ $c_2$ , and $c_3$ similarly. Now, translate the $lcm$ s into the following: \[1) \min(a_2,b_2)=3\] \[2) \min(a_3,b_3)=1\] \[3) \min(b_2,c_2)=2\] \[4) \min(b_3,c_3)=2\] \[5) \min(c_2,d_2)=1\] \[6) \min(c_3,d_3)=3\]

The ratio $\frac{[ADE]}{[ABC]}$ is thus equal to $\frac{1}{4}$ and the area of triangle $ADE$ is $\frac{1}{4} \cdot 120 = 30$ . Let side $BC$ be equal to $6x$ , then $BG = 5x, GC = x$ by the angle bisector theorem.

   - Substitute the expressions for \(A_n\), \(B_n\), and \(C","By geometric series, we have \begin{alignat*}{8} A_n&=a\bigl(\phantom{ }\underbrace{111\cdots1}_{n\text{ digits}}\phantom{ }\bigr)&&=a\left(1+10+10^2+\cdots+10^{n-1}\right)&&=a\cdot\frac{10^n-1}{9}, \\ B_n&=b\bigl(\phantom{ }\underbrace{111\cdots1}_{n\text{ digits}}\phantom{ }\bigr)&&=b\left(1+10+10^2+\cdots+10^{n-1}\right)&&=b\cdot\frac{10^n-1}{9}, \\ C_n&=c\bigl(\phantom{ }\underbrace{111\cdots1}_{2n\text{ digits}}\phantom{ }\bigr)&&=c\left(1+10+10^2+\cdots+10^{2n-1}\right)&&=c\cdot\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9}. \end{alignat*} By substitution, we rewrite the given equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ as \[c\cdot\frac{10^{2n}-1}{9} - b\cdot\frac{10^n-1}{9} = a^2\cdot\left(\frac{10^n-1}{9}\right)^2.\] Since $n > 0,$ it follows that $10^n > 1.$ We divide both sides by $\frac{10^n-1}{9}$ and then rearrange: \begin{align*} c\left(10^n+1\right) - b &= a^2\cdot\frac{10^n-1}{9} \\ 9c\left(10^n+1\right) - 9b &= a^2\left(10^n-1\right) \\ \left(9c-a^2\right)10^n &= 9b-9c-a^2. &&(\bigstar) \end{align*} Let $y=10^n.$ Note that $(\bigstar)$ is a linear equation with $y,$ and $y$ is a one-to-one function of $n.$ Since $(\bigstar)$ has at least two solutions of $n,$ it has at least two solutions of $y.$ We conclude that $(\bigstar)$ must be an identity, so we get the following system of equations: \begin{align*} 9c-a^2&=0, \\ 9b-9c-a^2&=0. \end{align*} The first equation implies that $c=\frac{a^2}{9}.$ Substituting this into the second equation gives $b=\frac{2a^2}{9}.$
To maximize $a + b + c = a + \frac{a^2}{3},$ we need to maximize $a.$ Clearly, $a$ must be divisible by $3.$ The possibilities for $(a,b,c)$ are $(9,18,9),(6,8,4),$ or $(3,2,1),$ but $(9,18,9)$ is invalid. Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ is $6+8+4=\boxed{18}.$"

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the integers \(A_n\), \(B_n\), and \(C_n\):**
   - \(A_n\) is an \(n\)-digit integer where each digit is \(a\). Thus, \(A_n = a \times \frac{10^n - 1}{9}\).

   - \(C_n\) is a \(2n\)-digit integer where each digit is \(c\). Thus, \(C_n = c \times \frac{10^{2n} - 1}{9}\).

2. **Set up the equation \(C_n - B_n = A_n^2\):**
   - Substitute the expressions for \(A_n\), \(B_n\), and \(C","Immediately start trying $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ . These give the system of equations $11c - b = a^2$ and $1111c - 11b = (11a)^2$ (which simplifies to $101c - b = 11a^2$ ). These imply that $a^2 = 9c$ , so the possible $(a, c)$ pairs are $(9, 9)$ $(6, 4)$ , and $(3, 1)$ . The first puts $b$ out of range but the second makes $b = 8$ . We now know the answer is at least $6 + 8 + 4 = 18$
We now only need to know whether $a + b + c = 20$ might work for any larger $n$ . We will always get equations like $100001c - b = 11111a^2$ where the $c$ coefficient is very close to being nine times the $a$ coefficient. Since the $b$ term will be quite insignificant, we know that once again $a^2$ must equal $9c$ , and thus $a = 9, c = 9$ is our only hope to reach $20$ . Substituting and dividing through by $9$ , we will have something like $100001 - \frac{b}{9} = 99999$ . No matter what $n$ really was, $b$ is out of range (and certainly isn't $2$ as we would have needed).
The answer then is $\boxed{18}$"

Let's denote the distance traveled during each of the 30-minute intervals as \(d_1\), \(d_2\), and \(d_3\) for the first, second, and third intervals respectively. We also denote the speeds during these intervals as \(v_1 = 60\) mph, \(v_2 = 65\) mph, and \(v_3\) (the unknown average speed we need to find).

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to evaluate all possible permutations of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 and determine how many unique results we can obtain for the given expression:

\[
(\underline{\qquad}\times\underline{\qquad})+(\underline{\qquad}\times\underline{\qquqquad})
\]

We will use Python to iterate through all permutations of the digits and compute the expression for each permutation to find out how many unique results we get.

Let's start by implementing this in Python.
```python
from itertools import permutations

# Define the digits to be used
digits = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# Set to store unique results
unique_results = set()

# Iterate through all permutations of the digits
for perm in permutations(digits):
    a, b, c, d = perm
    result = (a * b) + (c * d)
    unique_results.add(result)

# Number of unique results
num_unique_results = len(unique_results)
print((num_unique_results, unique_results))
```
```output
(3, {5, 6, 7})
```
The number of different values that can be obtained is \(\boxed{3}\). The unique results are 5, 6, and 7.

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of steps \( n \) in a staircase that uses 180 toothpicks.

First, let's analyze the pattern of the toothpicks in the staircase:

1. A 1-step staircase uses 4 toothpicks.
2. A 2-step staircase uses 10 toothpicks.
3. A 3-step staircase uses 18 toothpicks.

We can observe that the number of toothpicks increases by 6 for each step. This suggests a pattern:

- For a 1-step staircase: \( 4 = 6 \times 0 + 4 \)
- For a 2-step staircase: \( 10 = 6 \times 1 + 4 \)
- For a 3-step staircase: \( 18 = 6 \times 2 + 4 \)

From this, we can derive a formula for the number of toothpicks \( T(n) \) in an \( n \)-step staircase:
\[ T(n) = 6n + 4 \]

Given that \( T(n) = 180 \), we need to solve for \( n \):
","A staircase with $n$ steps contains $4 + 6 + 8 + ... + 2n + 2$ toothpicks. This can be rewritten as $(n+1)(n+2) -2$
So, $(n+1)(n+2) - 2 = 180$
So, $(n+1)(n+2) = 182.$
Inspection could tell us that $13 \cdot 14 = 182$ , so the answer is $13 - 1 = \boxed{12}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of steps \( n \) in a staircase that uses 180 toothpicks.

First, let's analyze the pattern of the toothpicks in the staircase:

1. A 1-step staircase uses 4 toothpicks.
2. A 2-step staircase uses 10 toothpicks.
3. A 3-step staircase uses 18 toothpicks.

We can observe that the number of toothpicks increases by 6 for each step. This suggests a pattern:

- For a 1-step staircase: \( 4 = 6 \times 0 + 4 \)
- For a 2-step staircase: \( 10 = 6 \times 1 + 4 \)
- For a 3-step staircase: \( 18 = 6 \times 2 + 4 \)

From this, we can derive a formula for the number of toothpicks \( T(n) \) in an \( n \)-step staircase:
\[ T(n) = 6n + 4 \]

Given that \( T(n) = 180 \), we need to solve for \( n \):
","Layer $1$ $4$ steps
Layer $1,2$ $10$ steps
Layer $1,2,3$ $18$ steps
Layer $1,2,3,4$ $28$ steps
From inspection, we can see that with each increase in layer the difference in toothpicks between the current layer and the previous increases by $2$ . Using this pattern:
$4, 10, 18, 28, 40, 54, 70, 88, 108, 130, 154, 180$
From this we see that the solution is $\boxed{12}$"

We have to solve for $n$ when $n^2+3n=180\Rightarrow n^2+3n-180=0$ . Factor to get $(n-12)(n+15)$ . The roots are $12$ and $-15$ . Clearly $-15$ is impossible so the answer is $\boxed{12}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability \( p \) that the sum of the numbers on the top faces of 7 dice is 10. Then, we need to find another sum that occurs with the same probability \( p \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Dice Sum Problem:**
   - Each die has faces numbered from 1 to 6.
   - The minimum sum when rolling 7 dice is \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \) and the maximum sum is \( 7 \times 6 = 42 \).
   - We need to find the probability of obtaining a sum of 10 and identify another sum with the same probability.

2. **Calculate the Probability:**
   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling 7 dice is \( 6^7 \).
   - We need to count the number of outcomes that give a sum of 10.

3. **Use Symmetry in Dice Sums:**
   - Due to the symmetry of the dice sums, if the probability of getting a sum \( S \) is the same as the probability of getting sum \( T \), then the sums are symmetric around the mean sum, which is \( \frac{7 \times (1 + 6)}{2} = 28 \).
   - Therefore, if \( S \) and \( T \) are symmetric sums, then \( T = 2 \times 28 - S \).

4. **Calculate the Symmetric Sum:**
   - For \( S = 10 \), the symmetric sum \( T \) would be \( 2 \times 28 - 10 \).","It can be seen that the probability of rolling the smallest number possible is the same as the probability of rolling the largest number possible, the probability of rolling the second smallest number possible is the same as the probability of rolling the second largest number possible, and so on. This is because the number of ways to add a certain number of ones to an assortment of $7$ ones is the same as the number of ways to take away a certain number of ones from an assortment of $7$ $6$ s.
So, we can match up the values to find the sum with the same probability as $10$ . We can start by noticing that $7$ is the smallest possible roll and $42$ is the largest possible roll. The pairs with the same probability are as follows:
$(7, 42), (8, 41), (9, 40), (10, 39), (11, 38)...$
However, we need to find the number that matches up with $10$ . So, we can stop at $(10, 39)$ and deduce that the sum with equal probability as $10$ is $39$ . So, the correct answer is $\boxed{39}$ , and we are done."

Next, we would like to know the height of the pyramid.

From this, we only need to find the altitude from point $F$ in $\triangle EFB$ and plug it into our formula for the volume of a rectangular pyramid. This is easy because we already know the area of $\triangle EFB$ and the base from point $F$ , so all we need to do is divide: $\frac{2 \times 3}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{13}} = \frac{6\sqrt{13}}{13}$ .

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can easily find that $EB = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{13}$ . Quickly computing, we find the area of the base, $BCHE = \sqrt{13} \cdot 1 = \sqrt{13}$ . Now we can make the following adjustments to our 3d shape as shown in the diagram. All we need now is to solve for the height, or $XM$ . We can set up to following equation due to our knowledge of altitudes(of the hypotenuse)in right triangles. We can set up the following equations: \begin{align*} b(a+b) &= (MH_1)^2 \\ a(a+b) &= (MH_2)^2 \\ b\sqrt{13} &= 3^2 \\ a\sqrt{13} &= 2^2 \\ b &= \dfrac{9}{\sqrt{13}} \\ a &= \dfrac{4}{\sqrt{13}} \\ (MX)^2 &= ab \\ (MX)^2 &= \dfrac{9 \cdot 4}{13} \\ MX &= \dfrac {3 \cdot 2}{\sqrt{13}} \\ \end{align*} Thus $\triangle V_{BCHEM} = \dfrac{\text{(height)}\cdot \text{(base)}}{3} = \dfrac{MX \cdot BCHE}{3} = \dfrac {\sqrt{13} \cdot \dfrac{3 \cdot 2}{\sqrt{13}}}{3}$ $= \boxed{2}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the region bounded by the curve traced by the centroid of \(\triangle ABC\) as point \(C\) moves around the circle.

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - \( \overline{AB} \) is the diameter of the circle with \( AB = 24 \).
   - The radius \( r \) of the circle is \( r = \frac{AB}{2} = 12 \).
   - The center of the circle is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), which we'll call \( O \).

2. **Centroid Calculation:**
   - The centroid \( G \) of \(\triangle ABC\) is given by the average of the coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - Since \( C \) lies on the circle, we can use parametric coordinates for \( C \).

3. **Parametric Coordinates:**
   - Let \( A = (-12, 0) \) and \( B = (12, 0) \).
   - Point \( C \) can be parameterized as \( C = (12 \cos \theta, 12 \sin \theta) \).

4. **Centroid Calculation:**
   - The coordinates of the centroid \( G \) are given by:

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the region bounded by the curve traced by the centroid of \(\triangle ABC\) as point \(C\) moves around the circle.

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - \( \overline{AB} \) is the diameter of the circle with \( AB = 24 \).
   - The radius \( r \) of the circle is \( r = \frac{AB}{2} = 12 \).
   - The center of the circle is the midpoint of \( \overline{AB} \), which we'll call \( O \).

2. **Centroid Calculation:**
   - The centroid \( G \) of \(\triangle ABC\) is given by the average of the coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - Since \( C \) lies on the circle, we can use parametric coordinates for \( C \).

3. **Parametric Coordinates:**
   - Let \( A = (-12, 0) \) and \( B = (12, 0) \).
   - Point \( C \) can be parameterized as \( C = (12 \cos \theta, 12 \sin \theta) \).

4. **Centroid Calculation:**
   - The coordinates of the centroid \( G \) are given by:
     \[
     G = \left( \frac{-12 + 12 + 12 \cos \theta}{3}, \frac{0 + 0 + 12 \sin \theta}{3} \right) = \left( 4 \cos \theta,","We assign coordinates. Let $A = (-12,0)$ $B = (12,0)$ , and $C = (x,y)$ lie on the circle $x^2 +y^2 = 12^2$ . Then, the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ is $G = \left(\frac{-12 + 12 + x}{3}, \frac{0 + 0 + y}{3}\right) = \left(\frac x3,\frac y3\right)$ . Thus, $G$ traces out a circle with a radius $\frac13$ of the radius of the circle that point $C$ travels on.

Firstly we can see clearly that the distance from the centroid to the center of the circle will remain the same no matter $C$ is on the circle. Also we can see that because the two legs of every triangles will always originate on the diameter, using inscribed angle rules, we know that $\angle C = \frac{180^\circ}{2} = 90^\circ$ . Now we know that all triangles $ABC$ will be a right triangle. We also know that the closed curve will simply be a circle with radius equal to the centroid of each triangle. We can now pick any arbitrary triangle, calculate its centroid, and the plug it in to the area formula. Using a $45^\circ$ $45^\circ$ $90^\circ$ triangle in conjunction with the properties of a centroid, we can quickly see that the length of the centroid is $4$ now we can plug it in to the area formula where we get $16\pi\approx\boxed{50}$"

   - We have a list of 2018 integers.
   - The list has a unique mode which occurs 10 times.
   - We need to minimize the number of distinct values in the list.

2. **Formulate the Problem Mathematically:**
   - Let \( k \) be the number of distinct values in the list.
   - To minimize \( k \), we need to ensure that the mode occurs exactly 10 times and no other number occurs 10 times or more.
   - If there are \( m \) distinct values, apart from the mode, each of the other \( m \) values must occur less than 10 times.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The mode occurs 10 times.
   - The remaining \( m \) distinct values each occur at most 9 times (since the mode occurs exactly 10 times and we want the uniqueness).
   - Therefore, the total number of occurrences of these \( m \) values is at most \( 9m \).

4. **Formulate the Inequality:**
   - The total number of integers in the list is 2018.
   - This gives us the inequality: \( 10 + 9m \geq 2018 \).

5. **Solve for \( m \):**

     \[

   The sum of the sequence is given by \(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_{2018} = 2018^{2018}\).

2. **Modulo Calculation:**

We check: $0^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$ $1^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{6}$ $2^3 \equiv 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{6}$ $3^3 \equiv 27 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}$ $4^3 \equiv 64 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$ , and $5^3 \equiv 125 \equiv 5 \pmod{6}$ .

Therefore, \[a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_{2018} \equiv a_1^3+a_2^3+\cdots+a_{2018}^3 \pmod{6}.\]

$\textbf{(A) } 1 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 7 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 21 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 92 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 106$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the side length of the equilateral convex octagon \(ABCDEFGH\) in the rectangle \(PQRS\). Let's break down the problem step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Rectangle \(PQRS\) has \(PQ = 8\) and \(QR = 6\).
   - Points \(A, B\) lie on \(\overline{PQ}\), \(C, D\) lie on \(\overline{QR}\), \(E, F\) lie on \(\overline{RS}\), and \(G, H\) lie on \(\overline{SP}\).
   - \(AP = BQ < 4\).

2. **Equilateral Octagon Properties:**
   - All sides are equal.
   - The octagon is convex.

3. **Symmetry and Coordinates:**
   - Let's denote the coordinates of \(P\) as \((0, 6)\), \(Q\) as \((8, 6)\), \(R\) as \((8, 0)\), and \(S\) as \((0, 0)\).
   - Let \(AP = BQ = x\) where \(0 < x < 4\).

4. **Finding","Let $AB$ , or the side of the octagon, be $x$ . Then, $BQ = \left(\frac{8-x}{2}\right)$ and $CQ = \left(\frac{6-x}{2}\right)$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem $BQ^2+CQ^2=x^2$ , or $\left(\frac{8-x}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{6-x}{2}\right)^2 = x^2$ . Multiplying this out, we have $x^2 = \frac{64-16x+x^2+36-12x+x^2}{4}$ . Simplifying, $-2x^2-28x+100=0$ . Dividing both sides by $-2$ gives $x^2+14x-50=0$ . Therefore, using the quadratic formula , we have $x=-7 \pm 3\sqrt{11}$ . Since lengths are always positive, then $x=-7+3\sqrt{11} \Rightarrow k+m+n=-7+3+11=\boxed{7}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid seating arrangements for six children such that no two siblings sit next to each other in the same row and no child sits directly in front of their sibling.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the children and pairs:**
   We have three pairs of siblings: \(A_1, A_2\), \(B_1, B_2\), and \(C_1, C_2\).

2. **Define the seating constraints:**
   - Siblings cannot sit next to each other in the same row.
   - No child can sit directly in front of their sibling.

3. **Generate all possible seating arrangements:**
   We need to generate all possible seating arrangements and filter out those that violate the constraints.

4. **Count the valid arrangements:**
   We will count the number of valid arrangements that satisfy all the constraints.

Let's implement this in Python using the sympy library to help with symbolic computation.

```python
import itertools

# Define the pairs of siblings
pairs = [('A1', 'A2'), ('B1', 'B2'), ('C1', 'C2')]

# Define the seating positions for two rows with three seats each
positions = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)]

# Function to check if a seating arrangement is valid
def is_valid(arrangement):
    # Check siblings are not next to each other in the same row
    for pair in pairs:
        for row in [arrangement[0","We can begin to put this into cases. Let's call the pairs $a$ $b$ and $c$ , and assume that a member of pair $a$ is sitting in the leftmost seat of the second row. We can have the following cases then.
Case $1$ : 
Second Row: a b c
Third Row: b c a
Case $2$ :
Second Row: a c b
Third Row: c b a
Case $3$ : 
Second Row: a b c
Third Row: c a b
Case $4$ : 
Second Row: a c b
Third Row: b a c
For each of the four cases, we can flip the siblings, as they are distinct. So, each of the cases has $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 8$ possibilities. Since there are four cases, when pair $a$ has someone in the leftmost seat of the second row, there are $32$ ways to rearrange it. However, someone from either pair $a$ $b$ , or $c$ could be sitting in the leftmost seat of the second row. So, we have to multiply it by $3$ to get our answer of $32 \cdot 3 = 96$ . So, the correct answer is $\boxed{96}$"

There is a child of each family in each row (There is an A, B, C in each row ) or There are two children of the same family in a row.
Starting off with the first case, we see that there are $3!=6$ ways to arrange the A,B,C. Then, we have to choose which sibling sits. There are $2$ choices for each set of siblings meaning we have $2^3=8$ ways to arrange that. So, there are $48$ ways to arrange the siblings in the first row. The second row is a bit easier. We see that there are $2$ ways to place the A sibling and each placement yields only $1$ possibility. So, our first case has $48\cdot2=96$ possibilities.
In our second case, there are $3$ ways to choose which set of siblings will be in the same row and $4$ ways to choose the person in between. So, there $3*4 = 12$ ways to arrange the first row. In the second row, however, we see that it is impossible to make everything work out. So, there are $0$ possibilities for this case.
Thus, there are $96+0 = \boxed{96}$ possibilities for this trip."

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Joey, Chloe, and Zoe and find out when Joey's age will be a multiple of Zoe's age for the second time.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the Ages:**
   - Let Chloe's age today be \( C \).
   - Joey is 1 year older than Chloe, so Joey's age is \( J = C + 1 \).
   - Zoe is exactly 1 year old today, so Zoe's age is \( Z = 1 \).

2. **Understand the Given Condition:**
   - Today is the first of the 9 birthdays on which Chloe's age will be an integral multiple of Zoe's age.
   - This means there will be 9 instances where \( C + k \) is a multiple of \( 1 + k \) for \( k \geq 0 \).

3. **Formulate the Problem:**
   - We need to find \( C \) such that \( C + k \) is a multiple of \( 1 + k \) for 9 consecutive values of \( k \).

4. **Solve for \( C \):**
   - The condition \( C + k \) is a multiple of \( 1 + k \) implies that \( (C + k) \% (1 + k) = 0 \).

5. **Find Joey's Age the Next Time it's a Multiple of Zoe's Age:**
   - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( J + n \) is a multiple of \( Z + n \).

Let's implement","Suppose that Chloe is $c$ years old today, so Joey is $c+1$ years old today. After $n$ years, Chloe and Zoe will be $n+c$ and $n+1$ years old, respectively. We are given that \[\frac{n+c}{n+1}=1+\frac{c-1}{n+1}\] is an integer for $9$ nonnegative integers $n.$ It follows that $c-1$ has $9$ positive divisors. The prime factorization of $c-1$ is either $p^8$ or $p^2q^2.$ Since $c-1<100,$ the only possibility is $c-1=2^2\cdot3^2=36,$ from which $c=37.$ We conclude that Joey is $c+1=38$ years old today.
Suppose that Joey's age is a multiple of Zoe's age after $k$ years, in which Joey and Zoe will be $k+38$ and $k+1$ years old, respectively. We are given that \[\frac{k+38}{k+1}=1+\frac{37}{k+1}\] is an integer for some positive integer $k.$ It follows that $37$ is divisible by $k+1,$ so the only possibility is $k=36.$ We conclude that Joey will be $k+38=74$ years old then, from which the answer is $7+4=\boxed{11}.$"

2. **Understand the Given Condition:**

   - This means there will be 9 instances where \( C + k \) is a multiple of \( 1 + k \) for \( k \geq 0 \).

3. **Formulate the Problem:**

4. **Solve for \( C \):**

Let's implement","Let Joey's age be $j$ , Chloe's age be $c$ , and we know that Zoe's age is $1$
We know that there must be $9$ values $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $c+k=a(1+k)$ where $a$ is an integer.
Therefore, $c-1+(1+k)=a(1+k)$ and $c-1=(1+k)(a-1)$ . Therefore, we know that, as there are $9$ solutions for $k$ , there must be $9$ solutions for $c-1$ . We know that this must be a perfect square. Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$ , so $c=37$ . Therefore, $j=38$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Joey, Chloe, and Zoe and find out when Joey's age will be a multiple of Zoe's age for the second time.

1. **Define the Ages:**
   - Let Chloe's age today be \( C \).
   - Joey is 1 year older than Chloe, so Joey's age is \( J = C + 1 \).
   - Zoe is exactly 1 year old today, so Zoe's age is \( Z = 1 \).

5. **Find Joey's Age the Next Time it's a Multiple of Zoe's Age:**
   - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( J + n \) is a multiple of \( Z + n \).

Let's implement","Here's a different way of stating Solution 2:
If a number is a multiple of both Chloe's age and Zoe's age, then it is a multiple of their difference. Since the difference between their ages does not change, then that means the difference between their ages has $9$ factors. Therefore, the difference between Chloe and Zoe's age is $36$ , so Chloe is $37$ , and Joey is $38$ . The common factor that will divide both of their ages is $37$ , so Joey will be $74$ . The answer is $7 + 4 =  \boxed{11}$"

   - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( J + n \) is a multiple of \( Z + n \).

Let's implement","Similar approach to above, just explained less concisely and more in terms of the problem (less algebraic).
Let $C+n$ denote Chloe's age, $J+n$ denote Joey's age, and $Z+n$ denote Zoe's age, where $n$ is the number of years from now. We are told that $C+n$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ exactly nine times. Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$ , it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$ , including every factor of $C-Z$ . For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$ , the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$ , which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$ . Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.) We also know $Z=1$ and $J=C+1$ . Thus, \begin{align*} C-Z&=36, \\ J-Z&=37. \end{align*} By our above logic, the next time $J-Z$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ will occur when $Z+n$ is a factor of $J-Z$ . Because $37$ is prime, the next time this happens is at $Z+n=37$ , when $J+n=74$ . The answer is $7+4=\boxed{11}$"

","Preamble: In this solution, we define the sequence $A$ to satisfy $a_n = f(n),$ where $a_n$ represents the $n$ th term of the sequence $A.$ This solution will show a few different perspectives. Even though it may not be as quick as some of the solutions above, I feel like it is an interesting concept, and may be more motivated.
To begin, we consider the sequence $B$ formed when we take the difference of consecutive terms between $A.$ Define $b_n = a_{n+1} - a_n.$ Notice that for $n \ge 4,$ we have
Notice that subtracting the second equation from the first, we see that $b_{n} = b_{n-1} - b_{n-2} + 1.$
If you didn’t notice that $B$ repeated directly in the solution above, you could also, possibly more naturally, take the finite differences of the sequence $b_n$ so that you could define $c_n = b_{n+1} - b_n.$ Using a similar method as above through reindexing and then subtracting, you could find that $c_n = c_{n-1} - c_{n-2}.$ The sum of any six consecutive terms of a sequence which satisfies such a recursion is $0,$ in which you have that $b_{n} = b_{n+6}.$ In the case in which finite differences didn’t reduce to such a special recursion, you could still find the first few terms of $C$ to see if there are any patterns, now that you have a much simpler sequence. Doing so in this case, it can also be seen by seeing that the sequence $C$ looks like \[\underbrace{2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1,}_{\text{cycle period}} 2, 1, -1, -2, -1, 1, \ldots\] in which the same result follows.
Using the fact that $B$ repeats every six terms, this motivates us to look at the sequence $B$ more carefully. Doing so, we see that $B$ looks like \[\underbrace{2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0,}_{\text{cycle period}} 2, 3, 2, 0, -1, 0, \ldots\] (If you tried pattern finding on sequence $B$ directly, you could also arrive at this result, although I figured defining a second sequence based on finite differences was more motivated.)
Now, there are two ways to finish.
Finish Method #1: Notice that any six consecutive terms of $B$ sum to $6,$ after which we see that $a_n = a_{n-6} + 6.$ Therefore, $a_{2018} = a_{2012} + 6 = \cdots = a_{2} + 2016 = \boxed{2017}.$"

First, we need to know whether or not $2016$ is part of the skip or repeat. We notice that $f(6),f(12), \ldots,f(6n)$ all satisfy $6+6(n-1)=n,$ and we know that $2016$ satisfies this, leaving $n=336.$ Therefore, we know that $2016$ is part of the repeat section. But what number does it repeat?
We know that the repeat period is $2,$ and it follows that pattern of $1,1,8,8,7,7.$ Again, since $f(6) = f(5)$ and so on  for the repeat section, $f(2016)=f(2015),$ so we don't need to worry about which one, since it repeats with period $2.$ We see that the repeat pattern of $f(6),f(12),\ldots,f(6n)$ follows $8,14,20,$ it is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $6.$ Therefore, $2016$ is the $335$ th term of this, but including $1,$ it is $336\cdot6+1=\boxed{2017}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest 4-digit even number \( n \) such that \( 323 \) is one of its divisors. We then need to determine the next smallest divisor of \( n \) after \( 323 \).

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Identify the smallest 4-digit even number \( n \) that has \( 323 \) as a divisor.**
2. **Find the next smallest divisor of \( n \) after \( 323 \).**

We will use Python and SymPy to help us with these steps.

First, let's find the smallest 4-digit number that is divisible by \( 323 \). Since \( n \) is even, we need to check the multiples of \( 323 \) until we find an even number.

Next, we will find the next smallest divisor of this number after \( 323 \).

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the divisor 323
divisor = 323

# Find the smallest 4-digit even number divisible by 323
n = sp.ceil(sp.Rational(400, divisor) * divisor)
while n % 2 != 0 or n < 10000:
    n += divisor

# Find the next smallest divisor of n after 323
next_divisor = sp.divisors(n)[sp.divisors(n).index(divisor) + ","Let $d$ be the next divisor written to the right of $323.$
If $\gcd(323,d)=1,$ then \[n\geq323d>323^2>100^2=10000,\] which contradicts the precondition that $n$ is a $4$ -digit number.
It follows that $\gcd(323,d)>1.$ Since $323=17\cdot19,$ the smallest possible value of $d$ is $17\cdot20=\boxed{340}(323,d)=17\cdot19\cdot20=6460.\] ~MRENTHUSIASM ~tdeng"

\[ a \cdot b + 63 = 20 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) + 12 \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b) \]

Let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\), and \(\text{gcd}(a, b)\):**
   \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) \cdot \text{gcd}(a, b) = a \cdot b \]

   Let \(d = \text{gcd}(a, b)\), \(a = dx\), and \(b = dy\) where \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).

4. **Substitute \(a\) and \(b\) into the equation:**
   \[ (dx)(dy) + 63 = 20 \cdot \left(\frac{(dx)(dy)}{d}\right) + 12 \cdot d \]
   Simplify:
   \[ d^2xy + 6","Let $x = \text{lcm}(a, b)$ , and $y = \text{gcd}(a, b)$ . Therefore, $a\cdot b = lcm(a, b)\cdot gcd(a, b) = x\cdot y$ . Thus, the equation becomes
\[x\cdot y + 63 = 20x + 12y\] \[x\cdot y - 20x - 12y + 63 = 0\]
Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick , we rewrite this equation as
\[(x - 12)(y - 20) - 240 + 63 = 0\] \[(x - 12)(y - 20) = 177\]
Since $177 = 3\cdot 59$ and $x > y$ , we have $x  - 12 = 59$ and $y - 20 = 3$ , or $x - 12 = 177$ and $y - 20 = 1$ . This gives us the solutions $(71, 23)$ and $(189, 21)$ . Since the $\text{GCD}$ must be a divisor of the $\text{LCM}$ , the first pair does not work. Assume $a>b$ . We must have $a = 21 \cdot 9$ and $b = 21$ , and we could then have $a<b$ , so there are $\boxed{2}$ solutions.

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation is \(x^2 + 10,000 \lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000 x\). Let \(n = \lfloor x \rfloor\), which means \(n \leq x < n+1\).

2. **Rewrite the Equation:**

   \]
   Rearrange it into a standard quadratic form:

3. **Quadratic Formula:**
   Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10,000\), and \(c = 10,000n\):
   \[
   x = \frac{10,000 \pm \sqrt{(10,000)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10,000n}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplify:

   x = \frac{10,000 \pm \sqrt{100,000,000 - 40,000n}}{2}

   x = ","This rewrites itself to $x^2=10,000\{x\}$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor + \{x\} = x$

Now notice that when $x=\pm 100$ the graph has a hole at $(\pm 100,10,000)$ which the equation $y=x^2$ passes through and then continues upwards. Thus our set of possible solutions is bounded by $(-100,100)$ . We can see that $y=x^2$ intersects each of the lines once and there are $99-(-99)+1=199$ lines for an answer of $\boxed{199}$"

   \[
   x = ","Same as the first solution, $x^2=10,000\{x\}$
We can write $x$ as $\lfloor x \rfloor+\{x\}$ . Expanding everything, we get a quadratic in $\{x\}$ in terms of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ \[\{x\}^2+ (2\lfloor x \rfloor -10,000)\{x\} + \lfloor x \rfloor ^2 = 0\]
We use the quadratic formula to solve for $\{x\}$ \[\{x\} = \frac {-2\lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000 \pm \sqrt{ ( 2\lfloor x \rfloor - 10,000 )^2 - 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2  }}{2} = \frac {-2\lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000 \pm \sqrt{ 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2 -40,000 \lfloor x \rfloor + 10,000^2- 4\lfloor x \rfloor^2  }}{2}\]
Since $0 \leq \{x\} < 1$ , we get an inequality which we can then solve. After simplifying a lot, we get that $\lfloor x \rfloor^2 + 2\lfloor x \rfloor - 9999 < 0$
Solving over the integers, $-101 < \lfloor x \rfloor < 99$ , and since $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is an integer, there are $\boxed{199}$ solutions. Each value of $\lfloor x \rfloor$ should correspond to one value of $x$ , so we are done."

### Solution: To solve the equation \(x^2 + 10,000 \lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000 x\), let's break it down step-by-step.

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation is \(x^2 + 10,000 \lfloor x \rfloor = 10,000 x\). Let \(n = \lfloor x \rfloor\), which means \(n \leq x < n+1\).

2. **Rewrite the Equation:**
   Substitute \(n\) into the equation:
   \[
   x^2 + 10,000n = 10,000x
   \]
   Rearrange it into a standard quadratic form:
   \[
   x^2 - 10,000x + 10,000n = 0
   \]

3. **Quadratic Formula:**
   Use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) where \(a = 1\), \(b = -10,000\), and \(c = 10,000n\):
   \[
   x = \frac{10,000 \pm \sqrt{(10,000)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10,000n}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{10,000 \pm \sqrt{100,000,000 - 40,000n}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = ","Let $x = a+k$ where $a$ is the integer part of $x$ and $k$ is the fractional part of $x$ .
We can then rewrite the problem below:
$(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000(a+k)$
From here, we get
$(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000a + 10000k$
Solving for $a+k = x$
$(a+k)^2 = 10000k$
$x = a+k = \pm100\sqrt{k}$
Because $0 \leq k < 1$ , we know that $a+k$ cannot be less than or equal to $-100$ nor greater than or equal to $100$ . Therefore:
$-99 \leq x \leq 99$
There are $199$ elements in this range, so the answer is $\boxed{199}$"

$(\lfloor x \rfloor +1)^2 = 10,000(1)$
$(\lfloor x \rfloor +1) = \pm 100$
$\lfloor x \rfloor = 99, -101$

   x = ","Firstly, if $x$ is an integer, then $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor=10,000x$ , so $x$ must be $0$
If $0<x<1$ , then we know the following:
$0<x^2<1$
$10,000\lfloor x \rfloor =0$
$0<10,000x<10,000$
Therefore, $0<x^2+10,000\lfloor x \rfloor <1$ , which overlaps with $0<10,000x<10,000$ . This means that there is at least one real solution between $0$ and $1$ . Since $x^2+10,000\lfloor x \rfloor$ increases quadratically and $10,000x$ increases linearly, there is only one solution for this case.
Similarly, if $1<x<2$ , then we know the following:
$1<x^2<4$
$10,000\lfloor x \rfloor =10,000$
$<10,000<10,000x<20,000$
By following similar logic, we can find that there is one solution between $1$ ad $2$
We can also follow the same process to find that there are negative solutions for $x$ as well.
There are not an infinite amount of solutions, so at one point there will be no solutions when $n<x<n+1$ for some integer $n$ . For there to be no solutions in a given range means that the range of $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor + x^2$ does not intersect the range of $10,000x$ $x^2$ will always be positive, and $10,000\lfloor x \rfloor$ is less than $10,000$ less than $10,000x$ , so when $x^2 >= 10,000$ , the equation will have no solutions. This means that there are $99$ positive solutions, $99$ negative solutions, and $0$ for a total of $\boxed{199}$ solutions."

$\lfloor x \rfloor \le x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1$
If $x= 5000 + 100 \sqrt{2500 - \lfloor x \rfloor}$ $x \ge 5000$ , it contradicts $x < \lfloor x \rfloor + 1 \le 2501$
So $x= 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - \lfloor x \rfloor}$
Let $k = \lfloor x \rfloor$ $x= 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k}$
$k \le 5000 - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k} < k + 1$

$0 \le 2500 - k - 100 \sqrt{2500 - k} + 2500 < 1$

# Define the costs and the maximum amount Pablo has
single_popsicle_cost = 1
three_box_cost = 2
five_box_cost = 3
max_amount = 8

# Define the number of popsicles per option
single_popsicles = 1
three_box_popsicles = 3
five_box_popsicles = 5

# Initialize the maximum number of popsicles
max_popsicles = 0

# Iterate through all possible combinations
# Single popsicles
single_popsicles_count = max_amount // single_popsicle_cost
remaining_amount = max_amount % single_popsicle_cost

# 3-popsicle boxes
three_boxes_count = remaining_amount // three_box_cost
remaining_amount = remaining_amount % three_box_cost

# 5-popsicle boxes
five_boxes_count = remaining_amount // five_box_cost
remaining_amount = remaining_amount % five_box_cost
","$$3$ boxes give us the most popsicles/dollar, so we want to buy as many of those as possible. After buying $2$ , we have $$2$ left. We cannot buy a third $$3$ box, so we opt for the $$2$ box instead (since it has a higher popsicles/dollar ratio than the $$1$ pack). We're now out of money. We bought $5+5+3=13$ popsicles, so the answer is $\boxed{13}$"

$\textbf{(A)}\ 13.5\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 14\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 14.5\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 15\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 15.5$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Mia and her mom to put all 30 toys into the toy box for the first time. We can break down the problem into smaller steps and use Python and SymPy to find the solution.

1. **Understand the rate of adding and removing toys:**
   - Every 30 seconds, Mia's mom puts 3 toys into the box.
   - Immediately after that, Mia takes out 2 toys.
   - So, the net increase in the number of toys in the box every 30 seconds is \(3 - 2 = 1\) toy.

2. **Calculate the total time to reach 30 toys:**
   - Since the net increase is 1 toy every 30 seconds, we need to determine how many 30-second intervals are required to reach 30 toys.
   - This is simply 30 toys divided by the net increase per interval (1 toy).

3. **Convert the total time into minutes:**
   - Since each interval is 30 seconds, the total time in seconds can be converted to minutes.

Let's implement this in Python to find the total time required.

```python
# Define the number of toys and the net increase per interval
total_toys = 30
net_increase_per_interval = 1

# Calculate the number of intervals needed
intervals_needed = total_toys / net_increase_per_interval

# Convert intervals to time in seconds
time_seconds = intervals_needed * 30","Every $30$ seconds, $3$ toys are put in the box and $2$ toys are taken out, so the number of toys in the box increases by $3-2=1$ every $30$ seconds. Then after $27 \times 30 = 810$ seconds (or $13 \frac{1}{2}$ minutes), there are $27$ toys in the box. Mia's mom will then put the remaining $3$ toys into the box after $30$ more seconds, so the total time taken is $27\times 30+30=840$ seconds, or $\boxed{14}$ minutes."

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to compare the distances traveled by Jerry and Silvia. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - Let the side length of the square field be \( s \).
   - Jerry walks along two sides of the square, first walking \( s \) units east and then \( s \) units north. Thus, the total distance Jerry walks is \( 2s \).
   - Silvia walks along the diagonal of the square, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The distance \( d \) is \( \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = s\sqrt{2} \).

2. **Calculate the Difference in Distances:**
   - The difference in distances is \( 2s - s\sqrt{2} \).

3. **Calculate the Percentage Difference:**
   - To find how much shorter Silvia's trip was compared to Jerry's trip, we calculate the percentage difference:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{2s - s\sqrt{2}}{2s} \right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Simplify the fraction and compute the approximate percentage.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the side length of the square
s = sp.symbols('s')

# Distance traveled by Jerry
jerry_distance = 2 * s

# Distance traveled by Silvia
silvia_distance = s * sp.sqrt(2)

# Calculate the percentage difference
percentage","Let $j$ represent how far Jerry walked, and $s$ represent how far Silvia walked. Since the field is a square, and Jerry walked two sides of it, while Silvia walked the diagonal, we can simply define the side of the square field to be one, and find the distances they walked. Since Jerry walked two sides, $j = 2$ Since Silvia walked the diagonal, she walked the hypotenuse of a $45$ $45$ $90$ triangle with leg length $1$ . Thus, $s = \sqrt{2} = 1.414...$ We can then take $\frac{j-s}{j} \approx \frac{2 - 1.4}{2}=0.3 \implies \boxed{30}$"

1. **Handshakes among the 10 people who know no one:**
   - These 10 people will shake hands with each other. The number of handshakes for \( n \) people is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

2. **Handshakes between the 20 people who know each other and the 10 people who know no one:**
   - These 20 people will not shake hands with each other since they know each other.
   - The 20 people will shake hands with the 10 people who know no one. The number of such handshakes is \( 20 \times 10 \).

Let's calculate the total number of handshakes using Python and sympy.

total_handshakes = handshakes_no_one_knows + handshakes_everyone_no_one

print(","Each one of the ten people has to shake hands with all the $20$ other people they don’t know. So $10\cdot20 = 200$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of handshakes that occur within the group. We can break the problem into two parts based on the knowledge of the people.

1. **Handshakes among the 10 people who know no one:**
   - These 10 people will shake hands with each other. The number of handshakes for \( n \) people is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

2. **Handshakes between the 20 people who know each other and the 10 people who know no one:**
   - These 20 people will not shake hands with each other since they know each other.
   - The 20 people will shake hands with the 10 people who know no one. The number of such handshakes is \( 20 \times 10 \).

handshakes_no_one_knows = sp.binomial(no_one_knows, 2)

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time taken by both Minnie and Penny for their respective routes and then find the difference in their times.

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. **Define the speeds for each segment:**
   - Minnie:
     - Flat: 20 kph
     - Downhill: 30 kph
     - Uphill: 5 kph
   - Penny:

2. **Calculate the time taken for each segment:**

     - From \(C\) to \(A\) (flat, 20 km): \( \text{Time} = \frac{20 \text{ km}}{20 \","The distance from town $A$ to town $B$ is $10$ km uphill, and since Minnie rides uphill at a speed of $5$ kph, it will take her $2$ hours. Next, she will ride from town $B$ to town $C$ , a distance of $15$ km all downhill. Since Minnie rides downhill at a speed of $30$ kph, it will take her half an hour. Finally, she rides from town $C$ back to town $A$ , a flat distance of $20$ km. Minnie rides on a flat road at $20$ kph, so this will take her $1$ hour. Her entire trip takes her $3.5$ hours.
Secondly, Penny will go from town $A$ to town $C$ , a flat distance of $20$ km. Since Penny rides on a flat road at $30$ kph, it will take her $\frac{2}{3}$ of an hour. Next Penny will go from town $C$ to town $B$ , which is uphill for Penny. Since Penny rides at a speed of $10$ kph uphill, and town $C$ and $B$ are $15$ km apart, it will take her $1.5$ hours. Finally, Penny goes from Town $B$ back to town $A$ , a distance of $10$ km downhill. Since Penny rides downhill at $40$ kph, it will only take her $\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour. In total, it takes her $29/12$ hours, which simplifies to $2$ hours and $25$ minutes.
Finally, Penny's $2$ hr $25$ min trip was $\boxed{65}$ minutes less than Minnie's $3$ hr $30$ min trip."

### Solution: To determine how many of the remaining rods can be chosen as the fourth rod to form a quadrilateral with the rods of lengths 3 cm, 7 cm, and 15 cm, we need to use the quadrilateral inequality theorem. The theorem states that for any quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of any three sides must be greater than the length of the fourth side.

Given rods: \( a = 3 \) cm, \( b = 7 \) cm, \( c = 15 \) cm.

We need to find the range of the fourth rod \( d \) such that:
1. \( a + b + c > d \)
2. \( a + b + d > c \)
3. \( a + c + d > b \)
4. \( b + c + d > a \)

Let's calculate these inequalities one by one:

1. \( 3 + 7 + 15 > d \)
\[ 25 > d \quad \Rightarrow \quad d < 25 \]

2. \( 3 + 7 + d > 15 \)
\[ 10 + d > 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d > 5 \]

3. \( 3 + 15 + d > 7 \)
\[ 18 + d > 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d > -11 \quad (\text{always true for positive } d) \]

4. \( 7 + 15 + d > 3 \)
\[ 22 + d > 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d > -19 \quad (\text{always true","The triangle inequality generalizes to all polygons, so $x < 3+7+15$ and $15<x+3+7$ yields $5<x<25$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand that the region described is a cylinder with a radius of 3 units along the length of the segment \(\overline{AB}\). The volume of this cylinder is given as \(216\pi\).

The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height (or length of the cylinder).

Given:
\[ V = 216\pi \]
\[ r = 3 \]

We need to find the length of the cylinder, which is the same as the length of the line segment \(\overline{AB}\).

Let's solve for \(h\) (the length of \(\overline{AB}\)):

\[ 216\pi = \pi \cdot 3^2 \cdot h \]
\[ 216\pi = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot h \]
\[ 216 = 9h \]
\[ h = \frac{216}{9} \]

Let's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Given values
V = 216 * 3.14  # Volume in terms of pi
r = 3

# Calculate the length of AB
h = V / (3.14 * r**2)
print(h)
```
```output

We know the volume of our region, so we set up the following equation (the volume of our cylinder + the volume of our two hemispheres will equal $216 \pi$ ):

Thus the height is $180 \pi$ divided by the area of the base, or $\frac{180 \pi}{9\pi}=20$ , so our answer is $\boxed{20}.$"

- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_n = (F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}) \mod 3 \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

Last week, Roger's allowance was $A$ dollars. The cost of his movie ticket was $20\%$ of the difference between $A$ and the cost of his soda, while the cost of his soda was $5\%$ of the difference between $A$ and the cost of his movie ticket.

### Solution: To solve this problem, let's define the following variables:
- \( A \): Roger's allowance
- \( T \): Cost of the movie ticket
- \( S \): Cost of the soda

According to the problem:
1. The cost of the movie ticket \( T \) is 20% of the difference between \( A \) and the cost of the soda \( S \):
\[ T = 0.20 (A - S) \]

2. The cost of the soda \( S \) is 5% of the difference between \( A \) and the cost of the movie ticket \( T \):
\[ S = 0.05 (A - T) \]

We need to solve these equations simultaneously to find \( T \) and \( S \) in terms of \( A \).

Let's solve these equations step-by-step using Python and sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
A, T, S = sp.symbols('A T S')

# Define the equations based on the problem statement
eq1 = sp.Eq(T, 0.20 * (A - S))
eq2 = sp.Eq(S, 0.05 * (A - T))

# Solve the system of equations
solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (T, S))

# Calculate the total cost as a fraction of A
total_cost = solution[T] + solution[S]
fraction_of_A = total_cost / A * ","Let $m$ be the price of a movie ticket and $s$ be the price of a soda.
Then,
\[m=\frac{A-s}{5}\] and \[s=\frac{A-m}{20}\] Then, we can turn this into \[5m=A-s\] \[20s=A-m\]
Subtracting and getting rid of A, we have $20s-5m=-m+s \rightarrow 19s=4m$ . Assume WLOG that $s=4$ $m=19$ , thus making a solution for this equation. Substituting this into the 1st equation, we get $A=99$ . Hence, $\frac{m+s}{A} = \frac{19+4}{99} \approx \boxed{23}$"

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Identify Points on the Circle:**
   The equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 25\) represents a circle with radius 5 centered at the origin. We need to find integer coordinate points on this circle.

2. **Check Distances:**
   We need to ensure that the distances \(PQ\) and \(RS\) are irrational. The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]
   For the distance to be irrational, the expression under the square root must be a non-perfect square integer.

3. **Maximize the Ratio:**
   Finally, we need to maximize the ratio \(\frac{PQ}{RS}\).

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to find the points and calculate the distances.

for x in range(-5, ","Because $P$ $Q$ $R$ , and $S$ are lattice points, there are only a few coordinates that actually satisfy the equation. The coordinates are $(\pm 3,\pm 4), (\pm 4, \pm 3), (0,\pm 5),$ and $(\pm 5,0).$ We want to maximize $PQ$ and minimize $RS.$ They also have to be non perfect squares, because they are both irrational. The greatest value of $PQ$ happens when $P$ and $Q$ are almost directly across from each other and are in different quadrants. For example, the endpoints of the segment could be $(-4,3)$ and $(3,-4)$ because the two points are almost across from each other. Another possible pair could be $(-4,3)$ and $(5,0)$ . To find out which segment is longer, we have to compare the distances from their endpoints to a diameter (which must be the longest possible segment). The closest diameter would be from $(-4,3)$ to $(4,-3)$ . The distance between $(3,-4)$ and $(-4,3)$ is greater than the distance between $(5,0)$ and $(4,-3)$ . Therefore, the segment from $(3,-4)$ to $(-4,3)$ is the longest attainable (the other possible coordinates for $P$ and $Q$ are $(4,3)$ and $(-3, -4)$ $(3, 4)$ and $(-4, -3)$ $(-3, 4)$ and $(4, -3)$ . The least value of $RS$ is when the two endpoints are in the same quadrant and are very close to each other. This can occur when, for example, $R$ is $(3,4)$ and $S$ is $(4,3).$ They are in the same quadrant and no other point on the circle with integer coordinates is closer to the point $(3,4)$ than $(4,3)$ and vice versa. Using the distance formula, we get that $PQ$ is $\sqrt{98}$ and that $RS$ is $\sqrt{2}.$ $\frac{\sqrt{98}}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{49}=\boxed{7}$"

Thus, the smallest possible value of $RS$ is $\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}} = \sqrt{2}$ . Assuming that $\frac{PQ}{RS} = 7$ , we plug in $RS = \sqrt{2}$ and solve for $PQ$ $PQ=7\sqrt{2}$ . Remember, we don't know if this is possible yet, we are only trying to figure out if it is. But for what values of $x$ and $y$ does $\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=7\sqrt2$ ? We see that this can easily be made into a $45-45-90$ triangle. But, instead of substituting $y=x$ into the equation and then using a whole lot of algebra, we can save time and use the little trick, that if in a $45-45-90$ triangle, the two $45$ degree sides have side length $s$ , then the hypotenuse is $s\sqrt2$ .

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Amelia wins. We can do this by considering the series of probabilities that Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn, and then summing these probabilities.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the Probabilities:**
   - \(P_A = \frac{1}{3}\) is the probability that Amelia gets heads.
   - \(P_B = \frac{2}{5}\) is the probability that Blaine gets heads.
   - \(P_T = 1 - P_A = \frac{2}{3}\) is the probability that Amelia gets tails.

2. **Calculate the Probability for Amelia's \(n\)-th Turn:**
   - If Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn, it means that both Amelia and Blaine had tails in the previous \(n-1\) turns, and Amelia's \(n\)-th turn is a head.
   - The probability that both get tails in \(n-1\) turns is \((1 - P_A)(1 - P_B)^{n-1}\).
   - Therefore, the probability that Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn is \(P_A \cdot (1 - P_A)(1 - P_B)^{n-1}\).

3. **Sum the Infinite Series:**
   - The total probability that Amelia wins is the sum of the probabilities for all \(n\) from 1 to infinity:

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Amelia wins. We can do this by considering the series of probabilities that Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn, and then summing these probabilities.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the Probabilities:**
   - \(P_A = \frac{1}{3}\) is the probability that Amelia gets heads.
   - \(P_B = \frac{2}{5}\) is the probability that Blaine gets heads.
   - \(P_T = 1 - P_A = \frac{2}{3}\) is the probability that Amelia gets tails.

2. **Calculate the Probability for Amelia's \(n\)-th Turn:**
   - If Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn, it means that both Amelia and Blaine had tails in the previous \(n-1\) turns, and Amelia's \(n\)-th turn is a head.
   - The probability that both get tails in \(n-1\) turns is \((1 - P_A)(1 - P_B)^{n-1}\).
   - Therefore, the probability that Amelia wins on her \(n\)-th turn is \(P_A \cdot (1 - P_A)(1 - P_B)^{n-1}\).

3. **Sum the Infinite Series:**
   - The total probability that Amelia wins is the sum of the probabilities for all \(n\) from 1 to infinity:
     \[
     P_A \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (1 - P_A)(1 -","Let $P$ be the probability Amelia wins.

The probability of her winning on her first turn is $\dfrac13$ . The probability of all the other cases is determined by the probability that Amelia and Blaine all lose until Amelia's turn on which she is supposed to win.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid seating arrangements for Alice, Bob, Carla, Derek, and Eric, given the constraints that Alice refuses to sit next to either Bob or Carla, and Derek refuses to sit next to Eric.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Identify the total number of unrestricted arrangements:**
   There are 5 people, so without any constraints, there are \(5!\) (120) possible arrangements.

2. **Apply the constraints:**
   - Alice cannot sit next to Bob.
   - Alice cannot sit next to Carla.
   - Derek cannot sit next to Eric.

We will use Python and SymPy to count the valid arrangements that satisfy these constraints.

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
import itertools

# Define the people
people = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']

# Function to check if a seating arrangement is valid
def is_valid(arrangement):
    # Check Alice's restriction (next to Bob or Carla)
    for i in range(4):
        if (arrangement[i] == 'A' and arrangement[i+1] in ['B', 'C']) or (arrangement[i+1] == 'A' and arrangement[i] in ['B', 'C']):
            return False
    # Check Derek's restriction (next to Eric)
    for i in range(4):
        if (arrangement[i] == 'D' and arrangement[i+1] == 'E') or (arrangement[i+1] == 'D' and arrangement[i] == 'E'):

    return True

all_permutations = itertools.permutations(people)

#","Let Alice be A, Bob be B, Carla be C, Derek be D, and Eric be E.
We can split this problem up into two cases:
$\textbf{Case 1: }$ A sits on an edge seat.
Since B and C can't sit next to A, that must mean either D or E sits next to A. After we pick either D or E, then either B or C must sit next to D/E. Then, we can arrange the two remaining people in two ways. Since there are two different edge seats that A can sit in, there are a total of $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16$
$\textbf{Case 2: }$ A does not sit in an edge seat.
Still, the only two people that can sit next to A are either D or E, and there are two ways to permute them, and this also handles the restriction that D can't sit next to E. Then, there are two ways to arrange B and C, the remaining people. However, there are three initial seats that A can sit in, so there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 12$ seatings in this case.
Adding up all the seatings, we have $16+12 = \boxed{28}$"

#","Label the seats (from left to right) $1$ through $5$ . The number of ways to seat Derek and Eric in the five seats with no restrictions is $5 \cdot 4=20$ . The number of ways to seat Derek and Eric such that they sit next to each other is $8$ (we can treat Derek and Eric as a ""block"". There are four ways to seat this ""block"", and two ways to permute Derek and Eric, for a total of $4\cdot 2=8$ ), so the number of ways such that Derek and Eric don't sit next to each other is $20-8=12$ . Note that once Derek and Eric are seated, we can divide into three cases.
The first case is that they sit at each end. There are two ways to seat Derek and Eric. But this is impossible because then Alice, Bob, and Carla would have to sit in some order in the middle three seats which would lead to Alice sitting next to Bob or Carla, a contradiction. So this case gives us $0$ ways.
Another possible case is if Derek and Eric sit in seats $2$ and $4$ in some order. There are $2$ possible ways to seat Derek and Eric like this. This leaves Alice, Bob, and Carla to sit in any order in the remaining three seats. Since no two of these three seats are consecutive, there are $3!=6$ ways to do this. So the second case gives us $2 \cdot 6=12$ total ways.
The last case is if once Derek and Eric are seated, exactly one pair of consecutive seats are available. There are $12-2-2=8$ ways to seat Derek and Eric like this. Once they are seated like this, Alice cannot sit in one of the two consecutive available seats without sitting next to Bob or Carla. So Alice has to sit in the other remaining chair. Then, there are two ways to seat Bob and Carla in the remaining two seats (which are consecutive). So this case gives us $8 \cdot 2=16$ ways.
So in total there are $12+16=28$ ways. Our answer is $\boxed{28}$ Minor $\LaTeX$ edits by fasterthanlight"

When Alice is with Carla: $2\cdot4!=48$

Alice is next to Carla, and Alice is also next to Bob.
There are two ways to rearrange Alice, Bob, and Carla so that this is true:
BAC and CAB. $2\cdot3!=12$
Alice is next to Carla, and Derek is also next to Eric. $2\cdot2\cdot3!=24$
Alice is next to Bob, and Derek is also next to Eric. $2\cdot2\cdot3!=24$
Finally, we count the cases where all three of these are true: $2\cdot2\cdot2=8$
We add up the cases where one of these are true: $48\cdot3=144$
Subtract the cases where two of these are true: $144-60=84$

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand how the sum of the digits of a number changes when the number is incremented by 1. Specifically, we need to analyze how the digits rearrange and how this affects the sum of the digits.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**

2. **Analyze the Increment:**
   When \( n \) is incremented by 1, the sum of the digits \( S(n+1) \) can change based on whether there is a carryover in the addition.

3. **Possible Changes in Sum of Digits:**
   - If there is no carryover, the sum of the digits increases by 1.
   - If there is a carryover, the sum of the digits decreases (because a higher place value digit is replaced by a lower one).

4. **Determine the Possible Values:**
   We need to check the possible values of \( S(n+1) \) by considering the possible carryovers.

Let's implement this in Python to check the possible values of \( S(n+1) \).

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):

Thus, if $S(n) = 1274$ , then $n \equiv 5 \pmod{9}$ , and thus $n+1 \equiv S(n+1) \equiv 6 \pmod{9}$ . The only answer choice that satisfies $n+1 \equiv 6 \pmod{9}$ is $\boxed{1239}$"

We can find out that the least number of digits the number $n$ has is $142$ , with $141$ $9$ 's and $1$ $5$ , assuming the rule above. No matter what arrangement or different digits we use, the divisibility rule stays the same. To make the problem simpler, we can just use the $141$ $9$ 's and $1$ $5$ . By randomly mixing the digits up, we are likely to get: $9999$ ... $9995999$ ... $9999$ . By adding $1$ to this number, we get: $9999$ ... $9996000$ ... $0000$ .
Knowing that $n+1$ is divisible by $9$ when $6$ , we can subtract $6$ from every available choice, and see if the number is divisible by $9$ afterwards.
After subtracting $6$ from every number, we can conclude that $1233$ (originally $1239$ ) is the only number divisible by $9$ . 
So our answer is $\boxed{1239}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to understand how the sum of the digits of a number changes when the number is incremented by 1. Specifically, we need to analyze how the digits rearrange and how this affects the sum of the digits.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are given that \( S(n) = 1274 \), where \( S(n) \) is the sum of the digits of \( n \). We need to determine which of the given options could be the value of \( S(n+1) \).

2. **Analyze the Increment:**
   When \( n \) is incremented by 1, the sum of the digits \( S(n+1) \) can change based on whether there is a carryover in the addition.

3. **Possible Changes in Sum of Digits:**
   - If there is no carryover, the sum of the digits increases by 1.
   - If there is a carryover, the sum of the digits decreases (because a higher place value digit is replaced by a lower one).

4. **Determine the Possible Values:**
   We need to check the possible values of \( S(n+1) \) by considering the possible carryovers.

Let's implement this in Python to check the possible values of \( S(n+1) \).

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

# Given S(n) = 1274
S_n = 1274

# Possible values to check
possible_values = [1, 3","The number $n$ can be viewed as having some unique digits in the front, following by a certain number of nines. We can then evaluate each potential answer choice.
If $A$ is correct, then $n$ must be some number $99999999...9$ , because when we add one to $99999999...9$ we get $10000000...00$ . Thus, if $1$ is the correct answer, then the equation $9x=1274$ must have an integer solution (i.e. $1274$ must be divisible by $9$ ). But since it does not, $1$ is not the correct answer.
If $B$ is correct, then $n$ must be some number $29999999...9$ , because when we add one to $29999999...9$ , we get $30000000...00$ . Thus, if $3$ is the correct answer, then the equation $2+9x=1274$ must have an integer solution. But since it does not, $3$ is not the correct answer.
Based on what we have done for evaluating the previous two answer choices, we can create an equation we can use to evaluate the final three possibilities. Notice that if $S(n+1)=N$ , then $n$ must be a number whose initial digits sum to $N-1$ , and whose other, terminating digits, are all $9$ . Thus, we can evaluate the three final possibilities by seeing if the equation $(N-1)+9x=1274$ has an integer solution.
The equation does not have an integer solution for $N=12$ , so $C$ is not correct. However, the equation does have an integer solution for $N=1239$ $x=4$ ), so $\boxed{1239}$ is the answer."

When $n+1$ , some $9$ 's will bump to 0, not affected its $\pmod 9$ . But the first non-9 digit (from right to left) will be bumped up by 1. So $S(n) + 1 \pmod {9} \equiv S(n+1) \pmod{9}$ . For example, $34999+1=35000$ , and the sum of digits $7+27 \rightarrow 8+0$
Since $S(n) \equiv 5 \pmod{9}$ , that means $S(n+1) \equiv 6 \pmod{9}$ . The only answer choice that meets this requirement is $\boxed{1239}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of triangles with positive area that have their vertices at points \((i, j)\) where \(i\) and \(j\) are integers between 1 and 5, inclusive.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Count the Total Number of Points:**
   Since \(i\) and \(j\) range from 1 to 5, there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) points in total.

2. **Choose 3 Points to Form a Triangle:**
   The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 25 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{25}{3}\).

3. **Exclude Degenerate Triangles:**
   A triangle is degenerate if the three points are collinear. We need to count and exclude these cases.

To implement this in Python using sympy:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 points out of 25.
2. Identify and count the degenerate triangles.
3. Subtract the number of degenerate triangles from the total number of triangles.

Let's write the Python code to solve this:

```python
import sympy as sp
from itertools import combinations

# Total number of points
total_points = 25

# Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 points out of 25
total_triangles = sp.binomial(total_points, 3)

# Function to check if three points are collinear
def are_collinear(p1, p2, p3):
    (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) = p1, p2, p3
    # Slope between p1 and p2 should be equal","We can solve this by finding all the combinations, then subtracting the ones that are on the same line. There are $25$ points in all, from $(1,1)$ to $(5,5)$ , so $\dbinom{25}3$ is $\frac{25\cdot 24\cdot 23}{3\cdot 2 \cdot 1}$ , which simplifies to $2300$ .
Now we count the ones that are on the same line. We see that any three points chosen from $(1,1)$ and $(1,5)$ would be on the same line, so $\dbinom53$ is $10$ , and there are $5$ rows, $5$ columns, and $2$ long diagonals, so that results in $120$ .
We can also count the ones with $4$ on a diagonal. That is $\dbinom43$ , which is 4, and there are $4$ of those diagonals, so that results in $16$ .
We can count the ones with only $3$ on a diagonal, and there are $4$ diagonals like that, so that results in $4$ .
We can also count the ones with a slope of $\frac12$ $2$ $-\frac12$ , or $-2$ , with $3$ points in each. Note that there are $3$ such lines, for each slope, present in the grid. In total, this results in $12$ .
Finally, we subtract all the ones in a line from $2300$ , so we have $2300-120-16-4-12=\boxed{2148}$"

    (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) = p1, p2, p3
    # Slope between p1 and p2 should be equal","There are $5 \times 5 = 25$ total points in all. So, there are $\dbinom{25}3 = 2300$ ways to choose the three vertices for the triangle. However, there are some cases where they 3 points chosen results in a straight line.
There are $10 \times 10 = 100$ cases where the 3 points chosen make up a vertical or horizontal line.
There are $2\left(1+\dbinom{4}3+\dbinom{5}3+\dbinom{4}3+1\right)=40$ cases where the 3 points all land on the diagonals of the square.
There are $3 \times 4=12$ ways where the 3 points make the a slope of $\frac{1}{2}$ $-\frac{1}{2}$ $2$ , and $-2$
Hence, there are $100+40+12=152$ cases where the chosen 3 points make a line. The answer would be $2300-152=\boxed{2148}$"

Given that \( g(x) \) is a factor of \( f(x) \), we can express \( f(x) \) as:

Our goal is to find the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \), and then evaluate \( f(1) \).

f = x**4 + x","$f(x)$ must have four roots, three of which are roots of $g(x)$ . Using the fact that every polynomial has a unique factorization into its roots, and since the leading coefficient of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are the same, we know that
\[f(x)=g(x)(x+p)\]
where $-p\in\mathbb{R}$ is the fourth root of $f(x)$ . 
(Using $(x+p) = (x-r))$ instead of $(x-r)$ makes the following computations less messy.)
Substituting $g(x)$ and expanding, we find that
\begin{align*}f(x)&=(x^3+ax^2+x+10)(x+p)\\ &=x^4+(a+p)x^3+(1+ap)x^2+(10+p)x+10r.\end{align*}
Comparing coefficients with $f(x)$ , we see that
\begin{align*} a+p&=1\\ 1+ap=b\\ 10+p&=100\\ 10p&=c.\\ \end{align*}
Let's solve for $a,b,c,$ and $p$ . Since $10+p=100$ $p=90$
Since $a+p=1$ $a=-89$
(Solution 1.1 branches from here and takes a shortcut.)
$c=(10)(90)=900$
Then, since $b=1+ap$ $b=-8009$ . Thus,
\[f(x)=x^4+x^3-8009x^2+100x+900.\]
(Solution 1.2 branches from here and takes another shortcut)
Taking $f(1)$ , we find that
\begin{align*} f(1)&=1^4+1^3-8009(1)^2+100(1)+900\\ &=1+1-8009+100+900\\ &=\boxed{7007}"

f = x**4 + x","We notice that the constant term of $f(x)=c$ and the constant term in $g(x)=10$ . Because $f(x)$ can be factored as $g(x) \cdot (x- r)$ (where $r$ is the unshared root of $f(x)$ , we see that using the constant term, $-10 \cdot r = c$ and therefore $r = -\frac{c}{10}$ .
Now we once again write $f(x)$ out in factored form:
\[f(x) = g(x)\cdot (x-r) = (x^3+ax^2+x+10)(x+\frac{c}{10})\]
We can expand the expression on the right-hand side to get:
\[f(x) = x^4+(a+\frac{c}{10})x^3+(1+\frac{ac}{10})x^2+(10+\frac{c}{10})x+c\]
Now we have $f(x) = x^4+(a+\frac{c}{10})x^3+(1+\frac{ac}{10})x^2+(10+\frac{c}{10})x+c=x^4+x^3+bx^2+100x+c$
Simply looking at the coefficients for each corresponding term (knowing that they must be equal), we have the equations: \[10+\frac{c}{10}=100 \Rightarrow c=900\] \[a+\frac{c}{10} = 1, c=900 \Rightarrow a + 90 =1 \Rightarrow a= -89\]
and finally,
\[1+\frac{ac}{10} = b = 1+\frac{-89 \cdot 900}{10} = b = -8009\]
We know that $f(1)$ is the sum of its coefficients, hence $1+1+b+100+c$ . We substitute the values we obtained for $b$ and $c$ into this expression to get $f(1) = 1 + 1 + (-8009) + 100 + 900 = \boxed{7007}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that each root of the polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + x + 10 \) is also a root of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c \).

Given that \( g(x) \) is a factor of \( f(x) \), we can express \( f(x) \) as:
\[ f(x) = (x^3 + ax^2 + x + 10) \cdot (x + d) \]

Our goal is to find the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \), and then evaluate \( f(1) \).

Let's break it down into steps:

1. **Express \( f(x) \) in terms of \( g(x) \) and \( x + d \).**
2. **Determine the coefficients by comparing the expanded form with \( f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + bx^2 + 100x + c \).**
3. **Evaluate \( f(1) \).**

Let's implement this in Python using sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

x, a, b, c, d = sp.symbols('x a b c d')

# Define the polynomials
g = x**3 + a*x**2 + x + 10
f = x**4 + x","Let $r_1,r_2,$ and $r_3$ be the roots of $g(x)$ . Let $r_4$ be the additional root of $f(x)$ . Then from Vieta's formulas on the quadratic term of $g(x)$ and the cubic term of $f(x)$ , we obtain the following:
\begin{align*} r_1+r_2+r_3&=-a \\  r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4&=-1 \end{align*}
Thus $r_4=a-1$
Now applying Vieta's formulas on the constant term of $g(x)$ , the linear term of $g(x)$ , and the linear term of $f(x)$ , we obtain:
\begin{align*} r_1r_2r_3  & = -10\\ r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1 &= 1\\  r_1r_2r_3+r_2r_3r_4+r_3r_4r_1+r_4r_1r_2  & = -100\\ \end{align*}
Substituting for $r_1r_2r_3$ in the bottom equation and factoring the remainder of the expression, we obtain:
\[-10+(r_1r_2+r_2r_3+r_3r_1)r_4=-10+r_4=-100\]
It follows that $r_4=-90$ . But $r_4=a-1$ so $a=-89$
Now we can factor $f(x)$ in terms of $g(x)$ as
\[f(x)=(x-r_4)g(x)=(x+90)g(x)\]
Then $f(1)=91g(1)$ and
\[g(1)=1^3-89\cdot 1^2+1+10=-77\]
Hence $f(1)=91\cdot(-77)=\boxed{7007}$"

We will tackle the situation one equation at a time, starting the $x$ terms. Looking at the coefficients, we get $\dfrac{90}{1-a} = 1$ \[\therefore 90=1-a.\] The solution to the previous is obviously $a=-89$ . We can now find $b$ and $c$ $\dfrac{b-1}{1-a} = a$ \[\therefore b-1=a(1-a)=-89*90=-8010\] and $b=-8009$ .

Clearly, $r(x) = 0$ because every single root in $g$ is also in $f$ , thus implying $g$ divides $f$ .
So, we wish to find $f(1) = g(1) \cdot q(1)$
Such an expression for $g(1)$ is pretty clean here as we can obtain $g(1) = a + 12$ , so we rewrite $f(1) = (a + 12) \cdot q(1)$ .
Well, now we need to know how $q$ is expressed in order to obtain $q(1)$ . This motivates us to long divide to obtain the quotient function. After simple long division $q(x) = x + (1 - a)$ . In addition, what is left over, namely $r(x)$ , has a constant piece of $a + 89$ (you'll see in a few sentences why we only care about particularly the constant piece).
Now we can write: $f(1) = (a + 12) \cdot (2 - a)$
Now, as we have already established $r(x) = 0$ for ALL $x$ that means $r(0)$ or the constant piece is $0$ , so $89 + a = 0$ , in which we obtain $a = -89$ . We now plug this back into our equation for $f(1)$ to get $(-89 + 12)(2 - (89)) = -77 \cdot 91 = \boxed{7007}$ . ~triggod"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find how many integers between 100 and 999 have at least one permutation of their digits that is a multiple of 11. 

First, let's recall that a number is a multiple of 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. For a three-digit number \(abc\), this can be expressed as:
\[ abc = 100a + 10b + c \]
For \(abc\) to be a multiple of 11:
\[ a - b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]

We will iterate through all three-digit numbers between 100 and 999, generate all permutations of their digits, and check if any permutation satisfies the above condition. If any permutation does, we count the original number.

Let's implement this in Python using the `itertools.permutations` function to generate permutations and sympy to handle the modular arithmetic checks.

```python
import itertools

# Function to check if a number is a multiple of 11
def is_multiple_of_11(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, str(n))
    return (a - b + c) % 11 == 0

# Counter for valid numbers
count = 0

# Iterate through all three-digit numbers between 100 and 999
for num in range(100, 1000):
    # Generate all permutations of the digits of the number
    digits = str(num)
   ","There are 81 multiples of 11 between $100$ and $999$ inclusive. Some have digits repeated twice, making 3 permutations.
Others that have no repeated digits have 6 permutations, but switching the hundreds and units digits also yield a multiple of 11. Switching shows we have overcounted by a factor of 2, so assign $6 \div 2 = 3$ permutations to each multiple.
There are now 81*3 = 243 permutations, but we have overcounted*. Some multiples of 11 have $0$ as a digit. Since $0$ cannot be the digit of the hundreds place, we must subtract a permutation for each.
There are 110, 220, 330 ... 990, yielding 9 extra permutations
Also, there are 209, 308, 407...902, yielding 8 more permutations.
Now, just subtract these 17 from the total (243) to get 226. $\boxed{226}$"

   ","We note that we only have to consider multiples of $11$ and see how many valid permutations each has. We can do casework on the number of repeating digits that the multiple of $11$ has:
$\textbf{Case 1:}$ All three digits are the same. 
By inspection, we find that there are no multiples of $11$ here.
$\textbf{Case 2:}$ Two of the digits are the same, and the third is different.
$\textbf{Case 2a:}$ There are $8$ multiples of $11$ without a zero that have this property: $121$ $242$ $363$ $484$ $616$ $737$ $858$ $979$ .
Each contributes $3$ valid permutations, so there are $8 \cdot 3 = 24$ permutations in this subcase.
$\textbf{Case 2b:}$ There are $9$ multiples of $11$ with a zero that have this property: $110$ $220$ $330$ $440$ $550$ $660$ $770$ $880$ $990$ .
Each one contributes $2$ valid permutations (the first digit can't be zero), so there are $9 \cdot 2 = 18$ permutations in this subcase.
$\textbf{Case 3:}$ All the digits are different.
Since there are $\frac{990-110}{11}+1 = 81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ , there are $81-8-9 = 64$ multiples of $11$ remaining in this case. However, $8$ of them contain a zero, namely $209$ $308$ $407$ $506$ $605$ $704$ $803$ , and $902$ . Each of those multiples of $11$ contributes $2 \cdot 2=4$ valid permutations, but we overcounted by a factor of $2$ ; every permutation of $209$ , for example, is also a permutation of $902$ . Therefore, there are $8 \cdot 4 / 2 = 16$ . Therefore, there are $64-8=56$ remaining multiples of $11$ without a $0$ in this case. Each one contributes $3! = 6$ valid permutations, but once again, we overcounted by a factor of $2$ (note that if a number ABC is a multiple of $11$ , then so is CBA). Therefore, there are $56 \cdot 6 / 2 = 168$ valid permutations in this subcase.
Adding up all the permutations from all the cases, we have $24+18+16+168 = \boxed{226}$"

We can then multiply by $6$ for each permutation of these multiples. (Yet some multiples do not have six distinct permutations.)
Now divide by $2$ , because if a number $abc$ with digits $a$ $b$ , and $c$ is a multiple of $11$ , then $cba$ is also a multiple of $11$ so we have counted the same permutations twice.
Basically, each multiple of $11$ has its own $3$ permutations (say $abc$ has $abc$ $acb$ and $bac$ whereas $cba$ has $cba$ $cab$ and $bca$ ). We know that each multiple of $11$ has at least $3$ permutations because it cannot have $3$ repeating digits.
Hence we have $243$ permutations without subtracting for overcounting.
Now note that we overcounted cases in which we have $0$ 's at the start of each number. So, in theory, we could just answer $A$ and then move on.
If we want to solve it, then we continue.
We overcounted cases where the middle digit of the number is $0$ and the last digit is $0$
Note that we assigned each multiple of $11$ three permutations.
The last digit is $0$ gives $9$ possibilities where we overcounted by $1$ permutation for each of $110, 220, ... , 990$
The middle digit is $0$ gives $8$ possibilities where we overcount by $1$ $605, 704, 803, 902$ and $506, 407, 308, 209$
Subtracting $17$ gives $\boxed{226}$"
"How many integers between $100$ and $999$ , inclusive, have the property that some permutation of its digits is a multiple of $11$ between $100$ and $999?$ For example, both $121$ and $211$ have this property.

$\textbf{(A) } 226 \qquad \textbf{(B) } 243 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 270 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 469 \qquad \textbf{(E) } 486$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find how many integers between 100 and 999 have at least one permutation of their digits that is a multiple of 11. 

First, let's recall that a number is a multiple of 11 if the difference between the sum of its digits in odd positions and the sum of its digits in even positions is a multiple of 11. For a three-digit number \(abc\), this can be expressed as:
\[ abc = 100a + 10b + c \]
For \(abc\) to be a multiple of 11:
\[ a - b + c \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]

We will iterate through all three-digit numbers between 100 and 999, generate all permutations of their digits, and check if any permutation satisfies the above condition. If any permutation does, we count the original number.

Let's implement this in Python using the `itertools.permutations` function to generate permutations and sympy to handle the modular arithmetic checks.

```python
import itertools

# Function to check if a number is a multiple of 11
def is_multiple_of_11(n):
    a, b, c = map(int, str(n))
    return (a - b + c) % 11 == 0

# Counter for valid numbers
count = 0

# Iterate through all three-digit numbers between 100 and 999
for num in range(100, 1000):
    # Generate all permutations of the digits of the number
    digits = str(num)
   ","Taken from solution three, we notice that there are a total of $81$ multiples of $11$ between $100$ and $999$ , and each of them have at most $6$ permutation (and thus is a permutations of $6$ numbers), giving us a maximum of $486$ valid numbers.
However, if $abc$ can be divided by $11$ , so can $cba$ , which is distinct if $c \neq a$ . And if $c = a$ then $abc$ and $cba$ have the same permutations. Either way, we have doubled counted. 
This reduces the number of permutations to $486/2 =  243$
Furthermore, if $a=b$ or $c=0$ (which turn out to be equivalent conditions! for example $220$ ), not all (inverse) permutations are distinct ( $\mathbf{2}20 = 2\mathbf{2}0$ ) or valid ( $022$ ). (There are 9 of these.)
Similarly, for $a0b$ , not all (inverse) permutations are valid. (There are 8 of these.)
As long as you notice at least one example of one of these 3 cases, you may infer that the answer must be smaller than $243$ . This leaves us with only one possible answer: $\boxed{226}$"

1. \( 10 \leq x \leq 99 \)
2. When \( x \) is multiplied by 3 and then 11 is added, the digits of the result are switched and the resulting number is between 71 and 75, inclusive.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. Define the original number \( x \).
2. Calculate the result of multiplying \( x \) by 3 and adding 11.
3. Switch the digits of the result.
4. Check if the switched digits result falls within the range 71 to 75.

The correct two-digit number that Mary thought of is \(\boxed{12}\).
","Let her $2$ -digit number be $x$ . Multiplying by $3$ makes it a multiple of $3$ , meaning that the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$ . Adding on $11$ increases the sum of the digits by $1+1 = 2,$ (we can ignore numbers such as $39+11=50$ ) and reversing the digits keeps the sum of the digits the same; this means that the resulting number must be $2$ more than a multiple of $3$ . There are two such numbers between $71$ and $75$ $71$ and $74.$ Now that we have narrowed down the choices, we can simply test the answers to see which one will provide a two-digit number when the steps are reversed: \[\] For $71,$ we reverse the digits, resulting in $17.$ Subtracting $11$ , we get $6.$ We can already see that dividing this by $3$ will not be a two-digit number, so $71$ does not meet our requirements. \[\] Therefore, the answer must be the reversed steps applied to $74.$ We have the following: \[\] $74\rightarrow47\rightarrow36\rightarrow12$ \[\] Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{12}$"

   We need to find the value of \(\frac{x + 3y}{3x - y}\):
   \[

   Substitute \(x = y\):
   \[

### Solution: To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( B \) as the number of blueberry jelly beans Camilla originally had.
- \( C \) as the number of cherry jelly beans Camilla originally had.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Camilla had twice as many blueberry jelly beans as cherry jelly beans:
   \[
   B = 2C
   \]

2. After eating 10 pieces of each kind, she now has three times as many blueberry jelly beans as cherry jelly beans:
   \[
   B - 10 = 3(C - 10)
   \]

We can solve these equations step-by-step.

First, we substitute \( B = 2C \) into the second equation:
\[
2C - 10 = 3(C - 10)
\]

Next, we solve for \( C \):
\[
2C - 10 = 3C - 30
\]

Rearrange to isolate \( C \):
\[
2C - 3C = -30 + 10
\]
\[
-C = -20
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

Now, substitute \( C = 20 \) back into the first equation to find \( B \):
\[
B = 2C = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

Thus, Camilla originally had 40 blueberry jelly beans.

Let's verify this solution using Python code to ensure accuracy.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the total distance Samia traveled.
   - Let \( t_1 \) be the time she biked before the tire went flat.
   - Let \( t_2 \) be the time she walked after the tire went flat.

2. **Formulate Equations:**
   - The total distance \( d \) is the sum of the distance biked and the distance walked: \( d = 2d_w \), where \( d_w \) is the walking distance.
   - The total time equation: \( t_1 + t_2 = 44 \) minutes (since 44 minutes is the total time taken to reach her friend's house).
   - The distance biked is \( d_b = \frac{d}{2} \) since she biked for half the distance.
   - The time to bike half the distance: \( t_1 = \frac{d/2}{17} \).
   - The time to walk the remaining distance: \( t_2 = \frac{d_w}{5} \).

3. **Convert All Quantities to the Same Units:**
   - Convert the total time from minutes to hours: \( 44 \) minutes \( = \frac{44}{60} \) hours.

4. **Set Up and Solve the Equations:**
   - Combine the equations to solve for \(","Let's call the distance that Samia had to travel in total as $2x$ , so that we can avoid fractions.

### Solution: To find the coordinates of point \( C \) in the isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with given vertices \( A(11, 9) \) and \( B(2, -3) \), and where the altitude from \( A \) meets the opposite side at \( D(-1, 3) \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the properties of the triangle:**
   - \( AB = AC \) implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \).
   - The altitude from \( A \) meets \( BC \) at \( D \), meaning \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( A \) to \( BC \).

2. **Use the properties of isosceles triangles and perpendicular lines:**
   - Since \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) (because \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) in an isosceles triangle).

3. **Calculate the coordinates of \( C \):**
   - Use the midpoint formula to find \( C \). The midpoint \( D \) of \( BC \) is given by:
     \[
     D = \left( \frac{x_B + x_C}{2}, \frac{y_B + y_C}{2} \right)

### Solution: To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( c \) given that the lines \( ax - 2y = c \) and \( 2x + by = -c \) are perpendicular and intersect at the point \( (1, -5) \).

1. **Identify the slopes of the lines:**
   - The slope of the first line \( ax - 2y = c \) can be found by rearranging it into slope-intercept form \( y = mx + b \).
   - The slope of the second line \( 2x + by = -c \) can also be found similarly.

2. **Use the condition for perpendicular lines:**
   - The product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is \(-1\).

3. **Substitute the point of intersection:**
   - Substitute \( (1, -5) \) into both equations to form a system of equations to solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
a, b, c = sp.symbols('a b c')
x, y = 1, -5

# Equations of the lines
eq1 = a*x - 2*y - c
eq2 = 2*x + b*y + c

# Slopes of the lines
slope1 = a / 2
slope2 = -2 / b

# Condition for perpendicular lines
perpendicular_condition = sp.Eq(slope1 * slope2, -1)

# Substitute the point of intersection (1, -5) into both equations
eq3 = eq1.subs({x: 1, y: -5})
eq4 = eq2.subs({x: 1, y: -5})

# Solve the system of equations","Writing each equation in slope-intercept form, we get $y=\frac{a}{2}x-\frac{1}{2}c$ and $y=-\frac{2}{b}x-\frac{c}{b}$ . We observe the slope of each equation is $\frac{a}{2}$ and $-\frac{2}{b}$ , respectively. Because the slope of a line perpendicular to a line with slope $m$ is $-\frac{1}{m}$ , we see that $\frac{a}{2}=-\frac{1}{-\frac{2}{b}}$ because it is given that the two lines are perpendicular. This equation simplifies to $a=b$
Because $(1, -5)$ is a solution of both equations, we deduce $a \times 1-2 \times -5=c$ and $2 \times 1+b \times -5=-c$ . Because we know that $a=b$ , the equations reduce to $a+10=c$ and $2-5a=-c$ . Solving this system of equations, we get $c=\boxed{13}$"

   - Let \( E_{\text{new}} \) be the fuel efficiency of the new car in kilometers per liter.
   - Given that the new car has 50% better fuel efficiency, we have:

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost of using both the old car and the new car for the same distance. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( E_{\text{old}} \) be the fuel efficiency of the old car in kilometers per liter.
   - Let \( E_{\text{new}} \) be the fuel efficiency of the new car in kilometers per liter.
   - Given that the new car has 50% better fuel efficiency, we have:
     \[
     E_{\text{new}} = 1.5 \times E_{\text{old}}
     \]
   - Let \( C_{\text{old}} \) be the cost per liter of gasoline for the old car.
   - Let \( C_{\text{new}} \) be the cost per liter of diesel for the new car.
   - Given that diesel is 20% more expensive, we have:
     \[
     C_{\text{new}} = 1.2 \times C_{\text{old}}
     \]

2. **Calculate Costs for a Fixed Distance \( D \):**
   - The amount of fuel used by the old car for distance \( D \) is \( \frac{D}{E_{\text{old}}} \).
   - The cost for the old car is \( \frac{D}{E_{\text{old}}} \times C_{\text{old}} \).
   - The amount of fuel used by the new car for distance \( D \) is \( \frac{D}{E_{\text{new}}} \).
","Assume WLOG that Elmer's old car's range is $100$ miles. So, Elmer's new car's range is $100 \times 1.5 = 150$ miles. Also, assume that the gas Elmer's old car uses is $$10$ , which means that diesel will cost $$12$ . Now we can deduce that Elmer's old car uses $10 \div 100 = $0.10$ per mile, and Elmer's new car uses $12 \div 150 = $0.08$ per mile. Therefore, Elmer's new car saves $\boxed{20}$ more money than his old car."

Let's denote \(x = |","Let us assign the following variables and put them in our Venn Diagram [1] $a$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Bridge and Yoga. $b$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Bridge and Painting. $c$ which designates the number of people that took all $3$ classes or what we want to find. $d$ which designates the number of people taking exactly Yoga and Painting.
Let's now recall what information we have given: There are exactly $9$ people that are taking at least $2$ classes meaning in other words, $9$ people total are taking strictly $2$ classes or strictly all the available classes meaning that $a+b+c+d=9$
Let's now start filling out the Venn Diagram:
Strictly taking Bridge, no other classes: We know in total, the number is $13$ , however this includes the people taking other classes too meaning we'd need to do some subtraction. From our Venn Diagram we see that we'd need to subtract the following variables to get our wanted outcome here, $a, b, c$ . Giving our answer as $13-(a+b+c)$
However, this equation seems complicated as it has $3$ different variables, so to make this look a lot less complicated we can use our earlier equation: $a+b+c+d=9$ to see that $a+b+c=9-d$ . This means that this can also be written as $13-(9-d)=4+d$
Strictly taking Yoga Only: The total number of people is $10$ , but this would also count people taking other classes too along with it, so we need to subtract this overcount which is visible in the Venn Diagram giving us: $10-(a+c+d)$
Again, we can use substitution to see that $a+c+d=9-b$ . This simplifies our equation to $10-(9-b)=1+b$
Strictly taking Painting Only: We know again, in total this number is $9$ , which also accounts for the people taking other classes too. From our Venn Diagram it is visible that we need to subtract: $b, c, d$ giving $9-(b+c+d)$
Again, through substitution of our first equation we see that $b+c+d=9-a$ meaning we can simplify this equation to $9-(9-a)=a$
If we add these newly made equations of strictly taking one class, we get the total number of people taking exactly one class as these equations each were a subcase for it. We can also find the exact number for this because we are given that there are exactly $20$ students in total, and $9$ students are taking exactly $2$ or $3$ classes, meaning that if we do $20-9$ we get our answer for the number of students taking exactly $1$ class because those taking exactly one class have no overlap with those taking exactly $2$ or exactly $3$ classes as shown in our Venn Diagram and because $1$ $2$ , and $3$ classes are subcases for finding the total number of students as we know that each student is in exactly $1, 2$ , or $3$ classes. This means that exactly $11$ students took strictly $1$ class.
We can add up our equations we found to equal $11$ because those equations were for subcases of having exactly $1$ class giving: $(4+d)+(1+b)+a=11$ $=5+a+b+d=11$
From our equation $a+b+c+d=9$ , we can substitute $9-c$ for $a+b+d$ giving us: $5+9-c=11$
This gives $c=3$ . We assigned $c$ for the number of people taking exactly $3$ classes meaning that when we find $c$ , we find the answer. This means our answer is $\boxed{3}$"

Students $1$ $2$ , and $3$ will also take bridge giving the desired count of $13$ total bridge students.
Now, all that is left are the students who take painting. There are $9$ students who take painting, so students $4$ through students $9$ take painting. Note that because $9$ people take at least two classes, students $10$ through $20$ are unable to take more than one class. This means that we must once more start over from the top.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that \(N^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\) for a randomly selected integer \(N\) in the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2020\).

First, let's analyze the possible remainders when \(N\) is divided by 5. Since \(N\) can be any integer from 1 to 2020, we consider the remainders modulo 5, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Next, we need to understand the behavior of \(N^{16} \mod 5\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer \(a\) and a prime \(p\), we have \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\). Here, \(p = 5\), so:
\[ N^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]

This implies:
\[ N^{16} = (N^{4})^{4} \equiv 1^{4} \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]

So, \(N^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}\) for any integer \(N\) that is not divisible by 5. Specifically, this will be true for \(N \equiv 1, 2, 3, 4 \pmod{5}\).

Let's count the numbers in the range \(1 \leq N \leq 2020\) that are not divisible by 5. We can do this by counting the numbers that are congruent to 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5.

Finally, we can calculate the probability by dividing the count of numbers that satisfy \(N^{16} \equiv ","Notice that we can rewrite $N^{16}$ as $(N^{4})^4$ . By Fermat's Little Theorem , we know that $N^{(5-1)} \equiv 1 \pmod {5}$ if $N \not \equiv 0 \pmod {5}$ . Therefore for all $N \not \equiv 0 \pmod {5}$ we have $N^{16} \equiv (N^{4})^4 \equiv 1^4 \equiv 1 \pmod 5$ . Since $1\leq N \leq 2020$ , and $2020$ is divisible by $5$ $\frac{1}{5}$ of the possible $N$ are divisible by $5$ . Therefore, $N^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod {5}$ with probability $1-\frac{1}{5},$ or $\boxed{45}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem of determining how many positive integers less than or equal to 2017 contain the digit '0', we can break it down into steps:

1. **Count numbers from 1 to 2017 that contain the digit '0'.**
2. **Count numbers from 1 to 2017 in total.**
3. **Subtract the count of numbers that do not contain the digit '0' from the total count to get the count of numbers that contain the digit '0'.**

Let's implement this step-by-step using Python and sympy.

```python
# Define the range
start = 1
end = 2017

# Function to count numbers containing the digit '0'
def count_numbers_with_zero(start, end):
    count = 0
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        if '0' in str(num):
            count += 1
    return count

# Calculate the count
count_with_zero = count_numbers_with_zero(start, end)
print(count_with_zero)
```
```output
471
```
The number of positive integers less than or equal to 2017 that contain the digit '0' is \(\boxed{471}\).
","We can use complementary counting. There are $2017$ positive integers in total to consider, and there are $9$ one-digit integers, $9 \cdot 9 = 81$ two digit integers without a zero, $9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729$ three digit integers without a zero, and $9 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 729$ four-digit integers starting with a 1 without a zero. Therefore, the answer is $2017 - 9 - 81 - 729 - 729 = \boxed{469}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem of determining how many positive integers less than or equal to 2017 contain the digit '0', we can break it down into steps:

1. **Count numbers from 1 to 2017 that contain the digit '0'.**
2. **Count numbers from 1 to 2017 in total.**
3. **Subtract the count of numbers that do not contain the digit '0' from the total count to get the count of numbers that contain the digit '0'.**

Let's implement this step-by-step using Python and sympy.

```python
# Define the range
start = 1
end = 2017

# Function to count numbers containing the digit '0'
def count_numbers_with_zero(start, end):
    count = 0
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        if '0' in str(num):
            count += 1
    return count

# Calculate the count
count_with_zero = count_numbers_with_zero(start, end)
print(count_with_zero)
```
```output
471
```
The number of positive integers less than or equal to 2017 that contain the digit '0' is \(\boxed{471}\).
","First, we notice there are no one-digit numbers that contain a zero. There are $9$ two-digit integers and $9 \cdot 9 + 9 \cdot 9 + 9 = 171$ three-digit integers containing at least one zero. Next, we consider the four-digit integers beginning with one. There are $3 \cdot 9 \cdot 9 = 243$ of these four-digit integers with one zero, ${3 \choose 2} \cdot 9 = 27$ with two zeros, and $1$ with three zeros $(1000)$ . Finally, we consider the numbers $2000$ to $2017$ which all contain at least one zero. Adding all of these together we get $9 + 171 + 243 + 27 + 1 + 18 = \boxed{469}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count all the monotonous positive integers. A positive integer is considered monotonous if it either has one digit or its digits form either a strictly increasing or strictly decreasing sequence when read from left to right.

Let's break down the problem into manageable parts:

1. **Single Digit Numbers:**
   - There are 10 single-digit monotonous numbers (0 through 9).

2. **Increasing Sequence:**
   - For an increasing sequence of \(n\) digits, the number of possible sequences is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{10}{n}\), which represents choosing \(n\) digits out of 10 where the order matters.

3. **Decreasing Sequence:**
   - For a decreasing sequence of \(n\) digits, the number of possible sequences is also given by \(\binom{10}{n}\), since choosing \(n\) digits out of 10 can form a decreasing sequence.

4. **Total Monotonous Numbers:**
   - Sum the number of single-digit numbers and the number of increasing and decreasing sequences for all \(n\) from 1 to 9.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to calculate the binomial coefficients and sum up all the monotonous numbers.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Number of single-digit monotonous numbers
single_digit_count = 10

# Calculate the total number of increasing and decreasing sequences
total_count = single_digit_count
n = 1
while n <= 9:
    total_count += sp.binomial(10, n","Case 1: monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order
There are $\sum_{n=1}^{9} \binom{9}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 1 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in ascending order. Note that 0 is not included since it will always be a leading digit and that is not allowed. Also, $\emptyset$ (the empty set) isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\sum_{n=0}^{9} \binom{9}{n} -\binom{9}{0} = 2^9 - 1 = 511.$
Case 2: monotonous numbers with digits in descending order
There are $\sum_{n=1}^{10} \binom{10}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 0 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in descending order. Note that 0 is included since we are allowed to end numbers with zeros. However, $\emptyset$ (the empty set) still isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\sum_{n=0}^{10} \binom{10}{n} -\binom{10}{0} = 2^{10} - 1 = 1023.$ We discard the number 0 since it is not positive. Thus there are $1022$ here.
Since the 1-digit numbers 1 to 9 satisfy both case 1 and case 2, we have overcounted by 9. Thus there are $511+1022-9=\boxed{1524}$ monotonous numbers."

$\bullet$ Case 1: Monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order.
Arrange the digits 1 through 9 in increasing order, and exclude 0 because a positive integer cannot begin with 0.
To get a monotonous number, we can either include or exclude each of the remaining 9 digits, and there are $2^9 = 512$ ways to do this. However, we cannot exclude every digit at once, so we subtract 1 to get $512-1=511$ monotonous numbers for this case.
$\bullet$ Case 2: Monotonous numbers with digits in descending order.
This time, we arrange all 10 digits in decreasing order and repeat the process to find $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to include or exclude each digit. We cannot exclude every digit at once, and we cannot include only 0, so we subtract 2 to get $1024-2=1022$ monotonous numbers for this case.
At this point, we have counted all of the single-digit monotonous numbers twice, so we must subtract 9 from our total.

If it does, then we know the $0$ must be the last digit in the number (and hence, the number has to be decreasing). Because $0$ is not positive, $0$ is not monotonous. So, we need to pick at least $1$ number in the set $[1, 9].$ After choosing our numbers, there will be just $1$ way to arrange them so that the overall number is monotonous.
In total, each of the $9$ digits can either be in the monotonous number or not, yielding $2^9 = 512$ total solutions. However, we said earlier that $0$ cannot be by itself so we have to subtract out the case in which we picked none of the numbers $1-9$ . So, this case gives us $511$
Onto the second case, if there are no $0$ s, then the number can either be arranged in ascending order or in descending order. So, for each selection of the digits $1- 9$ , there are $2$ solutions. This gives \[2 \cdot (2^9 - 1) = 2 \cdot 511 = 1022\] possibilities. Note that we subtracted out the $1$ because we cannot choose none of the numbers.
However, realize that if we pick just $1$ digit, then there is only $1$ arrangement. We cannot put a single digit in both ascending and descending order. So, we must subtract out $9$ from there (because there are $9$ possible ways to select one number and for each case, we overcounted by $1$ ).

We can set up a 1-1 Correspondence. For any subset of all the digits $1$ to $9$ $0$ cannot be a digit for ascending order), we can always rearrange them into an ascending monotonous number. Therefore, the number of subsets of the integers $1$ to $9$ is equivalent to the number of ascending integers. So, $2^9=512$ .

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the symmetries of the hexagon:**
   A regular hexagon has 6 rotations (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°) and 6 reflections (across lines through opposite vertices and midpoints of opposite sides).

2. **Count the number of colorings without considering symmetries:**
   We have 6 disks and we need to choose 3 to paint blue, then 2 of the remaining 4 to paint red, and the last one will be green.

3. **Use Burnside's Lemma to count distinct colorings:**
   Burnside's Lemma helps us count the number of distinct objects under group actions by averaging the number of elements fixed by each group element.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy and combinatorial counting.

1. The identity transformation. Since this doesn't change anything, there are $60$ fixed points.
2. Reflect on a line of symmetry. There are $3$ lines of reflections. Take the line of reflection going through the centers of circles $1$ and $5$ . Then, the colors of circles $2$ and $3$ must be the same, and the colors of circles $4$ and $6$ must be the same. This gives us $4$ fixed points per line of reflection.
3. Rotate by $120^\circ$ counterclockwise or clockwise with respect to the center of the diagram. Take the clockwise case for example. There will be a fixed point in this case if the colors of circles $1$ $4$ , and $6$ will be the same. Similarly, the colors of circles $2$ $3$ , and $5$ will be the same.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct paintings of the hexagons given the constraints of rotations and reflections. This is a combinatorial problem with symmetries.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the symmetries of the hexagon:**
   A regular hexagon has 6 rotations (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°) and 6 reflections (across lines through opposite vertices and midpoints of opposite sides).

2. **Count the number of colorings without considering symmetries:**
   We have 6 disks and we need to choose 3 to paint blue, then 2 of the remaining 4 to paint red, and the last one will be green.

3. **Use Burnside's Lemma to count distinct colorings:**
   Burnside's Lemma helps us count the number of distinct objects under group actions by averaging the number of elements fixed by each group element.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy and combinatorial counting.

```python
import sym","Note that the green disk has two possibilities; in a corner or on the side. WLOG, we can arrange these as
[asy] filldraw(circle((0,0),1),green); draw(circle((2,0),1)); draw(circle((4,0),1)); draw(circle((1,sqrt(3)),1)); draw(circle((3,sqrt(3)),1)); draw(circle((2,2sqrt(3)),1));  draw(circle((8,0),1)); filldraw(circle((10,0),1),green); draw(circle((12,0),1)); draw(circle((9,sqrt(3)),1)); draw(circle((11,sqrt(3)),1)); draw(circle((10,2sqrt(3)),1)); [/asy]
Take the first case. Now, we must pick two of the five remaining circles to fill in the red. There are $\dbinom{5}{2}=10$ of these. However, due to reflection we must divide this by two. But, in two of these cases, the reflection is itself, so we must subtract these out before dividing by 2, and add them back afterwards, giving $\frac{10-2}{2}+2=6$ arrangements in this case.
Now, look at the second case. We again must pick two of the five remaining circles, and like in the first case, two of the reflections give the same arrangement. Thus, there are also $6$ arrangements in this case.
In total, we have $6+6=\boxed{12}$"

   Burnside's Lemma helps us count the number of distinct objects under group actions by averaging the number of elements fixed by each group element.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy and combinatorial counting.

```python
import sym","We note that the group $G$ acting on the possible colorings is $D_3 = \{e, r, r^2, s, sr, sr^2\}$ , where $r$ is a $120^\circ$ rotation and $s$ is a reflection. In particular, the possible actions are the identity, the $120^\circ$ and $240^\circ$ rotations, and the three reflections.
We will calculate the number of colorings that are fixed under each action. Every coloring is fixed under the identity, so we count $\dfrac{6!}{3!2!1!} = 60$ fixed colorings. Note that no colorings are fixed under the rotations, since then the outer three and inner three circle must be the same color, which is impossible in our situation.
Finally, consider the reflection with a line of symmetry going through the top circle. Every fixed coloring is determined by the color of the top circle (either green or blue), and the color of the middle circles (either blue or red). Hence, there are $2\cdot 2 = 4$ colorings fixed under this reflection action. The other two actions are symmetric, so they also have $4$ fixed colorings. Hence, by Burnside's lemma, the number of unique colorings up to reflections and rotations is \[\dfrac{1}{|D_3|} (1\cdot 60 + 2\cdot 0 + 3\cdot 4) = \dfrac{1}{6}\cdot 72 = \boxed{12}.\]"

### Solution: To solve the problem of finding the remainder when the number \( N \) is divided by 45, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. The number \( N \) is formed by writing the integers from 1 to 44 in order, creating a 79-digit number.

We need to find \( N \mod 45 \). Since 45 can be factored into \( 45 = 5 \times 9 \), we can find the remainders of \( N \) when divided by 5 and 9, and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the final remainder modulo 45.

1. **Remainder when \( N \) is divided by 5:**
   - Numbers 1 to 44 include all possible last digits from 0 to 4 at least once.
   - The sum of the digits from 0 to 4 is 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
   - Since there are 10 complete cycles of 0 to 4 within the numbers from 1 to 44, the sum of the digits in these cycles is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
   - The total sum modulo 5 is \( 50 \mod 5 = 0 \).

2. **Remainder when \( N \) is divided by 9:**
   - We can find the sum of the digits of \( N \) modulo 9.
   - The sum of the digits from 1 to 44 can be calculated.

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the vertices of an equilateral triangle that lie on the hyperbola \(xy = 1\) and have one vertex as the centroid of the triangle.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Define the Hyperbola:**
   The hyperbola is given by the equation \(xy = 1\).

2. **Define the Equilateral Triangle:**
   An equilateral triangle has three vertices, and we need to ensure these vertices lie on the hyperbola.

3. **Centroid of the Triangle:**
   The centroid of the triangle is given as one of the vertices. Let's denote this vertex as \(A = (x_1, y_1)\).

4. **Find Other Vertices:**
   Since the triangle is equilateral, the other vertices \(B\) and \(C\) must be symmetrically placed relative to the centroid.

5. **Calculate the Square of the Area:**
   Finally, we need to calculate the square of the area of the triangle.

Let's implement this step-by-step in Python using SymPy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x1, y1 = sp.symbols('x1 y1')
x2, y2 = sp.symbols('x2 y2')
x3, y3 = sp.symbols('x3 y3')

# Centroid of the triangle is vertex A (x1, y1)
A = (x1, y1)

# Vertices B and C must lie on the hyperbola xy = 1
B = (x2, y2)
C = (x3, y3)

# Centroid formula: (x1 + x2 + x3) / 3 = x1
centroid_x = (x1 +","Without loss of generality, let the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ be $G = (1, 1)$ . Assuming we don't know one vertex is $(-1, -1)$ we let the vertices be $A\left(x_1, \frac{1}{x_1}\right), B\left(x_2, \frac{1}{x_2}\right), C\left(x_3, \frac{1}{x_3}\right).$
Since the centroid coordinates are the average of the vertex coordinates, we have that $\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3}{3}=1$ and $\frac{\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\frac{1}{x_3}}{3}=1.$
We also know that the centroid is the orthocenter in an equilateral triangle, so $CG \perp AB.$ Examining slopes, we simplify the equation to $x_1x_2x_3 = -1$ . From the equation $\frac{\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\frac{1}{x_3}}{3}=1,$ we get that $x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_2x_3 = -3$ . These equations are starting to resemble Vieta's:
$x_1+x_2+x_3=3$
$x_1x_2+x_1x_3+x_2x_3 = -3$
$x_1x_2x_3=-1$
$x_1,x_2,x_3$ are the roots of the equation $x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0$ . This factors as $(x+1)(x^2-4x+1)=0 \implies x = -1, 2 \pm \sqrt3,$ for the points $(-1, -1), (2+\sqrt3, 2-\sqrt3), (2-\sqrt3, 2+\sqrt3)$ . The side length is clearly $\sqrt{24}$ , so the square of the area is $\boxed{108}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find Isabella's score on her sixth test, given that her score on the seventh test was 95. We also know that the average score after each test was always an integer.

Let's denote the scores of the seven tests as \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g\) where \(g = 95\). The average score after each test is an integer, which gives us the following constraints:

1. \(\frac{a + b + c + d + e + f + 95}{7}\) must be an integer.
2. \(\frac{a + b + c + d + e + f}{6}\) must be an integer.

Let's denote the sum of the first six scores as \(S\). Then we have:
\[
\frac{S + 95}{7} = \text{integer}
\]
\[
\frac{S}{6} = \text{integer}
\]

From the above, we can derive that \(S\) must be a multiple of 6, and \(S + 95\) must be a multiple of 7.

# Solve the conditions
solutions = sp.solve(conditions, S)","Let the sum of the scores of Isabella's first $6$ tests be $S$ . Since the mean of her first $7$ scores is an integer, then $S + 95 \equiv 0 \text{ (mod 7)}$ , or $S \equiv3 \text{ (mod 7)}$ . Also, $S \equiv 0 \text{ (mod 6)}$ , so by the CRT $S \equiv 24 \text{ (mod 42)}$ . We also know that $91 \cdot 6 \leq S \leq 100 \cdot 6$ , so by inspection, $S = 570$ . However, we also have that the mean of the first $5$ test scores must be an integer, so the sum of the first $5$ test scores must be an multiple of $5$ , which implies that the $6$ th test score is $\boxed{100}$"

So the possible sums for the 7 test scores so that they provide an integer average are $7(97), 7(96), 7(95)$ and $7(94)$ which are $679, 672, 665,$ and $658$ respectively.  Now in order to get the sum of the first 6 tests, we subtract $95$ from each sum producing $584, 577, 570,$ and $563$ . Notice only $570$ is divisible by $6$ so, therefore, the sum of the first $6$ tests is $570$ . We need to find her score on the $6th$ test so we have to find which number will give us a number divisible by $5$ when subtracted from $570.$ Since $95$ is the $7th$ test score and all test scores are distinct that only leaves $\boxed{100}$"

### Solution: To solve the problem \(10^x \cdot 100^{2x} = 1000^5\), we need to express all terms with the same base. Here, the base 10 can be used:

1. Express \(100\) and \(1000\) in terms of base \(10\):
   \[
   100 = 10^2
   \]
   \[
   1000 = 10^3
   \]

2. Substitute these expressions into the original equation:
   \[

   \]

3. Simplify the exponents:
   \[
   10^x \cdot 10^{4x} = 10^{15}
   \]

4. Combine the exponents on the left-hand side:
   \[
   10^{x + 4x} = 10^{15}
   \]
   \[
   10^{5x} = 10^{15}
   \]

5. Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal to each other:
   \[
   5x = 15
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(3\).

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve them using Python and SymPy.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the amount Ben spent.
   - Let \( D \) be the amount David spent.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - For every dollar Ben spent, David spent $0.25 less: \( D = B - 0.25B = 0.75B \).
   - Ben paid $12.50 more than David: \( B = D + 12.50 \).

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - Substitute \( D = 0.75B \) into \( B = D + 12.50 \) to find \( B \).
   - Once \( B \) is found, use \( D = 0.75B \) to find \( D \).
   - Finally, add \( B \) and \( D \) to get the total amount spent together.

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
B = sp.symbols('B')

# Define the equations
D = 0.75 * B
equation = sp.Eq(B, D + 12.50)

# Solve for B
B_value = sp.solve(equation, B)[0]

# Calculate D
D_value = 0.75 * B_value

# Calculate the total amount spent together
total_spent = B_value + D_value

# Print the total amount spent together
print(total_spent)
```
","If Ben paid $$ 12.50$ more than David, then he paid $\frac{12.5}{.25}= $ 50.00$ . Thus, David paid $$ 37.50$ , and they spent $50.00+37.50 =$ 87.50 \implies \boxed{87.50}$"

$\textbf{(A)}\ 48\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 56\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 64\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 96\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 144$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given volume options (48, 56, 64, 96, 144) could be the volume of a rectangular box with side lengths in the ratio \(1:3:4\).

Given the side lengths are in the ratio \(1:3:4\), we can represent the side lengths as \(x\), \(3x\), and \(4x\), where \(x\) is a positive integer. Therefore, the volume \(V\) of the box can be calculated as:
\[ V = x \cdot 3x \cdot 4x = 12x^3 \]

We need to check which of the given volumes (48, 56, 64, 96, 144) is a multiple of 12 times the cube of an integer.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to check each option.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the possible volumes
volumes = [48, 56, 64, 96, 144]

# Function to check if a volume can be expressed as 12 * x^3
def check_volume(volume):
    x = sp.symbols('x')
    equation = 12 * x**3 - volume
    solution = sp.solve(equation, x)
    # Check if the solution is an integer
    for sol in solution:
        if sol.is_integer:
            return True
    return False

# Check each volume
valid_volumes = [volume for volume in volumes if check_volume(volume)]
print(valid_volumes)
```
```output
[64]
```
The output indicates that the only valid volume among the given options that fits the criteria is \(64\).

Thus, the volume of the box could be \(\boxed","Let the smallest side length be $x$ . Then the volume is $x \cdot 3x \cdot 4x =12x^3$ . If $x=2$ , then $12x^3 = 96 \implies \boxed{96.}$"

$\textbf{(A)}\ 13\qquad\textbf{(B)}\ 26\qquad\textbf{(C)}\ 102\qquad\textbf{(D)}\ 103\qquad\textbf{(E)}\ 110$
### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to compare the sum of Star's numbers (1 through 30) with the sum of Emilio's numbers after replacing every digit '2' with '1'. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of Star's numbers:** This is simply the sum of the first 30 natural numbers.
2. **Calculate Emilio's numbers by replacing every '2' with '1':** We need to list these numbers and then sum them up.
3. **Find the difference between the two sums.**

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to ensure accuracy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Calculate the sum of Star's numbers (1 to 30)
star_sum = sum(range(1, 31))

# Step 2: Calculate Emilio's numbers by replacing every '2' with '1'
emilio_numbers = []
for num in range(1, 31):
    num_str = str(num)
    emilio_num_str = num_str.replace('2', '1')

emilio_sum = sum(emilio_numbers)

# Step 4: Calculate the difference between Star's sum and Emilio's sum
difference = star_sum - emilio_sum

# Print the result

   The mode is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. Since \( x \) is the mode, \( x \) must appear at least twice in the data set.

### Solution: To solve this problem, let's denote the initial amount of money Fox has as \( x \). We will track the amount of money Fox has after each crossing and toll payment.

1. **First Crossing:**
   - Fox's money doubles: \( 2x \)
   - Fox pays 40 coins: \( 2x - 40 \)

2. **Second Crossing:**
   - Fox's new amount doubles: \( 2(2x - 40) = 4x - 80 \)
   - Fox pays 40 coins: \( 4x - 80 - 40 = 4x - 120 \)

3. **Third Crossing:**
   - Fox's new amount doubles: \( 2(4x - 120) = 8x - 240 \)
   - Fox pays 40 coins: \( 8x - 240 - 40 = 8x - 280 \)

Given that all Fox's money is gone after the third crossing, we have:
\[ 8x - 280 = 0 \]

Let's solve this equation for \( x \):

\[ 8x - 280 = 0 \]
\[ 8x = 280 \]
\[ x = \frac{280}{8} \]
\[ x = 35 \]

So, Fox initially had 35 coins. We can verify this by simulating the process step-by-step using Python.

","Knowing that each row number can stand for the number of coins there are in the row, we can just add until we get $2016$ .
Notice that $1 + 2 + 3 \cdots + 10 = 55.$ Knowing this, we can say that $11 + 12 \cdots + 20 = 155$ and $21 + \cdots +30 =255$ and so on. This is a quick way to get to the point that N is between 60 and 70. By subtracting from the sum of the number from 1 through 70, we learn that when we subtract $70, 69, 68, 67, 66, 65,$ and $64, N = 63.$ Adding those two digits, we get the answer $\boxed{9}.$ - CorgiARMY"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to track the movements of each friend and determine the initial seating arrangement. Let's break down the movements step-by-step and use Python and SymPy to solve it.

1. **Initial Setup:**
   Let's denote the initial seating arrangement as a list of 5 variables: \( A, B, C, D, E \), where each variable represents the initial seat number of each friend.

2. **Movements:**
   - Bea moves two seats to the right.
   - Ceci moves one seat to the left.
   - Dee and Edie switch seats.
   - Ada returns to an end seat.

3. **Final Position:**
   - Ada ends up in an end seat, which means she sits in seat 1 or seat 5.

4. **Track Movements:**
   We will track the movements and solve for the initial positions based on the final positions.

Let's implement this in Python using SymPy to solve for the initial seating arrangement.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the initial seats as symbols
Ada, Bea, Ceci, Dee, Edie = sp.symbols('Ada Bea Ceci Dee Edie')

# Define the movements
Bea_new_seat = Bea + 2
Ceci_new_seat = Ceci - 1
Dee_Edie_new_seat = Edie, Dee
Ada_new_seat = 1  # Ada returns to","Assume that Edie and Dee were originally in seats 3 and 4. If this were so, there is no possible position for which Bea can move 2 seats to the right. The same applies for seats 2 and 3. This means that either Edie or Dee was originally in an edge seat. If Edie and Dee were in seats 1 and 2, then Bea must have been in seat 3, which would mean that seat 5 would now be occupied and the positioning would not work. So, Edie and Dee are in seats 4 and 5. This means that Bea was originally in seat 1. Ceci must have been in seat 3 to keep seat 1 open, which leaves seat 2.
Thus, Ada was in seat $\boxed{2}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the radius of a new cookie formed by reshaping the leftover scrap from seven cookies, each with a radius of 1 inch.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the area of the original dough**: The dough is a circle with a certain radius.
2. **Calculate the total area of the seven cookies**: Each cookie has an area of \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\) square inches.
3. **Determine the area of the leftover scrap**: Subtract the total area of the seven cookies from the area of the original dough.
4. **Calculate the radius of the new cookie**: The area of the new cookie will be equal to the area of the leftover scrap, and we can solve for the radius.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the radius of the original dough and each cookie
R_dough = 3  # The radius of the original dough circle
r_cookie = 1  # The radius of each cookie

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest \( N \) such that \( P(N) < \frac{321}{400} \).

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Understanding \( P(N) \):**
   \( P(N) \) is the probability that at least \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the green balls are on one side of the red ball.

2. **Setting up the problem:**
   - The red ball can be placed at any position from 1 to \( N+1 \) (since there are \( N \) green balls and 1 red ball).
   - For at least \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the green balls to be on one side of the red ball, \( \lceil \frac{3}{5}(N+1) \rceil \) green balls must be on one side.

3. **Calculating \( P(N) \):**
   - We need to count the number of positions where \( \lceil \frac{3}{5}(N+1) \rceil \) green balls are on one side of the red ball.
   - We then divide this count by \( N+1 \) to get the probability \( P(N) \).

4. **Finding the smallest \( N \) such that \( P(N) < \frac{321}{400} \).**

Let's implement","Let $n = \frac{N}{5}$ . Then, consider $5$ blocks of $n$ green balls in a line, along with the red ball. Shuffling the line is equivalent to choosing one of the $N + 1$ positions between the green balls to insert the red ball. Less than $\frac{3}{5}$ of the green balls will be on the same side of the red ball if the red ball is inserted inside the middle block of $n$ balls, and there are $n - 1$ positions where this happens. Thus, $P(N) = 1 - \frac{n - 1}{N + 1} = \frac{4n + 2}{5n + 1}$ , so
\[P(N) = \frac{4n + 2}{5n + 1} < \frac{321}{400}.\]
Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $400(5n+1)$ , we have
\[400(4n+2)<321(5n+1),\]
and by the distributive property,
\[1600n+800<1605n+321.\]
Subtracting $1600n+321$ on both sides of the inequality gives us
\[479<5n.\]
Therefore, $N=5n>479$ , so the least possible value of $N$ is $480$ . The sum of the digits of $480$ is $\boxed{12}$"

Let $N=10$ $P(N)=\frac{10}{11}$
Let $N=15$ $P(N)=\frac{14}{16}$
Notice that the fraction can be written as $1-\frac{\frac{N}{5}-1}{N+1}$
Now it's quite simple to write the inequality as $1-\frac{\frac{N}{5}-1}{N+1}<\frac{321}{400}$
We can subtract $1$ on both sides to obtain $-\frac{\frac{N}{5}-1}{N+1}<-\frac{79}{400}$
Dividing both sides by $-1$ , we derive $\frac{\frac{N}{5}-1}{N+1}>\frac{79}{400}$ . (Switch the inequality sign when dividing by $-1$

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to label the vertices of a cube with integers from 1 to 8 such that the sum of the numbers on the vertices of each face is the same. Additionally, we consider two arrangements the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotating the cube.

First, let's calculate the sum of all the integers from 1 to 8, which is:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 \]

Since a cube has 6 faces and each face must have the same sum, the sum for each face is:
\[ \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

Next, we need to find the distinct ways to label the cube such that the sum of the four vertices on each face is 6.

We will use Python to iterate through all permutations of the numbers 1 to 8 and count the valid arrangements that satisfy the given conditions.

Let's start by writing the code to generate all permutations and check for valid arrangements.
```python
import itertools

# All permutations of numbers 1 to 8
vertices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
permutations = list(itertools.permutations(vertices))

# Define the faces of the cube using vertex indices
faces = [
    (0, 1, 2, 3),  # front
    (4, 5, 6, 7),  # back
    (0, 1, 4, 5),  # top
    (2, 3, 6, ","Note that the sum of the numbers on each face must be 18, because $\frac{1+2+\cdots+8}{2}=18$
So now consider the opposite edges (two edges which are parallel but not on same face of the cube);
they must have the same sum value too.
Now think about the points $1$ and $8$ . If they are not on the same edge, they must be endpoints of opposite edges, and we should have $1+X=8+Y$ . However, this scenario would yield no solution for $[7,2]$ , which is a contradiction. (Try drawing out the cube if it doesn't make sense to you.)
The points $1$ and $8$ are therefore on the same side and all edges parallel must also sum to $9$
Now we have $4$ parallel sides $1-8, 2-7, 3-6, 4-5$ .
Thinking about $4$ endpoints, we realize they need to sum to $18$ .
It is easy to notice only $1-7-6-4$ and $8-2-3-5$ would work.
So if we fix one direction $1-8 ($ or $8-1)$ all other $3$ parallel sides must lay in one particular direction. $(1-8,7-2,6-3,4-5)$ or $(8-1,2-7,3-6,5-4)$
Now, the problem is the same as arranging $4$ points in a two-dimensional square, which is $\frac{4!}{4}=\boxed{6.}$"

    (0, 1, 4, 5),  # top
    (2, 3, 6, ","Again, all faces sum to $18.$ If $x,y,z$ are the vertices next to $1$ , then the remaining vertices are $17-x-y, 17-y-z, 17-x-z, x+y+z-16.$ Now it remains to test possibilities. Note that we must have $x+y+z>17.$ Without loss of generality, let $x<y<z.$ \[3,7,8\text{: Does not work.}\] \[4,6,8\text{: Works.}\] \[4,7,8\text{: Works.}\] \[5,6,7\text{: Does not work.}\] \[5,6,8\text{: Does not work.}\] \[5,7,8\text{: Does not work.}\] \[6,7,8\text{: Works.}\]
Keeping in mind that a) solutions that can be obtained by rotating each other count as one solution and b) a cyclic sequence is always asymmetrical, we can see that there are two solutions (one with $[x, y, z]$ and one with $[z, y, x]$ ) for each combination of $x$ $y$ , and $z$ from above.

If $8$ and $6$ were on the same edge, it is possible to achieve the desired sum only with the numbers $1$ and $3$ since the values must be distinct. Similarly, if $8$ and $7$ were on the same edge, the only way to get the sum is with $1$ and $2$ . This means that $6$ and $7$ are not on the same edge as $8$ , or in other words they are diagonally across from it on the same face, or on the other end of the cube.
Now we look at three cases, each yielding two solutions which are reflections of each other:
1) $6$ and $7$ are diagonally opposite $8$ on the same face.
2) $6$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $7$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face.
3) $7$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $6$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face.

This problem breaks down into finding $QP:PB$ and $DQ:QB$ . We can find the first using mass points, and the second using similar triangles.
Draw point $G$ on $DB$ such that $FG\parallel CD$ . Then, by similar triangles $FG=BF\cdot 2=4$ . Again, by similar triangles $AQB$ and $FQG$ $AQ:FQ=AB:FG=6:4=3:2$ . Now we begin Mass Points.
We will consider the triangle $ABF$ with center $P$ , so that $E$ balances $B$ and $F$ , and $Q$ balances $A$ and $F$ . Assign a mass of $1$ to $B$ . Then, $BE:FE=1:1$ so $F=B=1$ . By mass points addition, $E=B+F=2$ since $E$ balances $B$ and $F$ .
Also, $AQ:QF=3:2$ so $A=\frac{2}{3}F=\frac{2}{3}$ so $Q=\frac{5}{3}$ . Then, $QP:PB=1:\frac{5}{3}=3:5$
To calculate $DQ:BQ$ , extend $AF$ past $F$ to point $H$ such that $H$ lies on $BC$ . Then $AFB$ is similar to $HAD$ so $DH=3\cdot AD=9$ . Also, $AQB$ is similar to $HQD$ so $DQ:BQ=9:6=3:2$
Now, we wish to get $DQ:QP:PB$ . Observe that $BQ=QP+PB$ . So, $DQ:BQ=DQ:QP+PB=3:2$ so (since $QP:PB=3:5$ has sum $3+5=8$ ), $DQ:QP+PB=3:2=12:8$ . now, we may combine the two and get $DQ:QP:PB=12:3:5$ so $r+s+t=12+3+5=\boxed{20}$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio \(BP:PQ:QD\) in the given rectangle \(ABCD\) with specific points \(E\) and \(F\).

1. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Rectangle \(ABCD\) has \(AB = 6\) and \(BC = 3\).
   - Points \(E\) and \(F\) divide \(BC\) into three equal segments, so \(BE = EF = FC = 1\).

2. **Find Coordinates:**
   - \(A = (0, 0)\)
   - \(B = (6, 0)\)
   - \(C = (6, 3)\)
   - \(D = (0, 3)\)
   - \(E = (6, 1)\)
   - \(F = (6, 2)\)

3. **Find Intersection Points:**
   - We need to find the intersection of \(\overline{AE}\) and \(\overline{BD}\), and \(\overline{AF}\) and \(\overline{BD}\).

4. **Calculate Ratios:**
   - Use the section formula to find the coordinates of \(P\) and \(Q\).
   - Calculate the distances \(BP\), \(PQ\), and \(QD\).
   - Express the ratio \(BP:PQ:QD\) in its simplest form.

","We can set coordinates for the points. $D=(0,0), C=(6,0),  B=(6,3),$ and $A=(0,3)$ . The line $BD$ 's equation is $y = \frac{1}{2}x$ , line $AE$ 's equation is $y = -\frac{1}{6}x + 3$ , and line $AF$ 's equation is $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + 3$ . Adding the equations of lines $BD$ and $AE$ , we find that the coordinates of $P$ are $\left(\frac{9}{2},\frac{9}{4}\right)$ . Furthermore we find that the coordinates of $Q$ are $\left(\frac{18}{5}, \frac{9}{5}\right)$ . Using the Pythagorean Theorem , we get that the length of $QD$ is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{18}{5}\right)^2+\left(\frac{9}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{405}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{405}}{5} = \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{5}$ , and the length of $DP$ is $\sqrt{\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^2+\left(\frac{9}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{81}{4} + \frac{81}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{405}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{405}}{4} = \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{4}.$ $PQ = DP - DQ = \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{5} = \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{20}.$ The length of $DB = \sqrt{6^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}$ . Then $BP= 3\sqrt{5} - \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{4}.$ The ratio $BP : PQ : QD = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{4} : \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{20} : \frac{9\sqrt{5}}{5} = 15\sqrt{5} : 9\sqrt{5} : 36\sqrt{5} = 15 : 9 : 36 = 5 : 3 : 12.$ Then $r, s,$ and $t$ is $5, 3,$ and $12$ , respectively. The problem tells us to find $r + s + t$ , so $5 + 3 + 12 = \boxed{20}$ ~ minor LaTeX edits by dolphin7"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integer divisors of \(81n^4\) given that \(110n^3\) has 110 positive integer divisors.

Let's break down the problem into manageable steps:

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - \(110 = 2 \times 5 \times 11\)
   - \(81 = 3^4\)

2. **Divisor Function:**
   The number of divisors of a number \(N\) with prime factorization \(N = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k}\) is given by:
   \[
   D(N) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
   \]

3. **Determine \(n\):**
   Given that \(110n^3\) has 110 divisors, we need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   110 = D(110n^3) = D(2 \times 5 \times 11 \times n^3)
   \]
   Since \(n^3\) contributes \(D(n^3) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\) to the total number of divisors, we need to find \(n\) that satisfies this condition.

4. **Find Divisors of \(81n^4\):**
   Once \(n\) is determined, we can find the number of divisors of \(81n^4\):
   \[
","Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11$ , we have that the number is equal to $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 \cdot n^3$ .  This has $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$ .  This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$ , so we have $2^{10} \cdot 5 \cdot 11$ has $44$ factors.  To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$ , so we can set $n=2^3 \cdot 5$ , so $2^{10} \cdot 5^4 \cdot 11$ has $110$ factors.  Therefore, $n=2^3 \cdot 5$ .  In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$ , we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$ , and find the factors of that number.  We have $3^4 \cdot 2^{12} \cdot 5^4$ , and this has $5 \cdot 13 \cdot 5=\boxed{325}$ factors."

","$110n^3$ clearly has at least three distinct prime factors, namely 2, 5, and 11.
The number of factors of $p_1^{n_1}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$ is $(n_1+1)\cdots(n_k+1)$ when the $p$ 's are distinct primes. This tells us that none of these factors can be 1. The number of factors is given as 110. The only way to write 110 as a product of at least three factors without $1$ s is $2\cdot 5\cdot 11$
We conclude that $110n^3$ has only the three prime factors 2, 5, and 11 and that the multiplicities are 1, 4, and 10 in some order.  I.e., there are six different possible values of $n$ all of the form $n=p_1\cdot p_2^3$
$81n^4$ thus has prime factorization $81n^4=3^4\cdot p_1^4\cdot p_2^{12}$ and a factor count of $5\cdot5\cdot13=\boxed{325}$"

Let $a=b=c.$ From the first two givens, this implies that

From $a\diamondsuit\,{a}=1,$ this equation simply becomes $a\diamondsuit\,{1}=a.$
Let $c=b.$ Substituting this into the first two conditions, we see that

\[a\diamondsuit\, {1}=(a\diamondsuit\, {b})\cdot{b} \implies a=(a\diamondsuit\,{b})\cdot{b}.\]
Since $a, b$ and $c$ are nonzero, we can divide by $b$ which yields,

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and some geometry.

Given:
- A quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with radius \(200\sqrt{2}\)
- Three sides of the quadrilateral have length \(200\)
- We need to find the length of the fourth side.

Let's denote the quadrilateral as \(ABCD\) with \(AB = BC = 200\), \(CD = x\) (the unknown side length), and \(AD\) being the fourth side.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Use the Circle's Radius:**
   The radius of the circle is \(200\sqrt{2}\). The diameter of the circle is \(400\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Properties of Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).

3. **Apply Ptolemy's Theorem:**
   Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of its two opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals.
   \[
   AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD
   \]

4. **Use Symmetry and Geometry:**
   Since \(AB = BC = 200\) and the lengths are equal, we can infer that the quadrilateral is symmetric with respect to one of its diagonals.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for the length of the fourth side.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Given values
radius = ","[asy] size(250); defaultpen(linewidth(0.4)); //Variable Declarations real RADIUS; pair A, B, C, D, E, F, O; RADIUS=3;  //Variable Definitions A=RADIUS*dir(148.414); B=RADIUS*dir(109.471); C=RADIUS*dir(70.529); D=RADIUS*dir(31.586); O=(0,0);  //Path Definitions path quad= A -- B -- C -- D -- cycle;  //Initial Diagram draw(Circle(O, RADIUS), linewidth(0.8)); draw(quad, linewidth(0.8)); label(""$A$"",A,W); label(""$B$"",B,NW); label(""$C$"",C,NE); label(""$D$"",D,ENE); label(""$O$"",O,S); label(""$\theta$"",O,3N);  //Radii draw(O--A); draw(O--B); draw(O--C); draw(O--D);  //Construction E=extension(B,O,A,D);  label(""$E$"",E,NE);  F=extension(C,O,A,D);  label(""$F$"",F,NE);   //Angle marks draw(anglemark(C,O,B));  [/asy]
Let $AD$ intersect $OB$ at $E$ and $OC$ at $F.$
$\overarc{AB}= \overarc{BC}= \overarc{CD}=\theta$
$\angle{BAD}=\frac{1}{2} \cdot \overarc{BCD}=\theta=\angle{AOB}$
From there, $\triangle{OAB} \sim \triangle{ABE}$ , thus:
$\frac{OA}{AB} = \frac{AB}{BE} = \frac{OB}{AE}$
$OA = OB$ because they are both radii of $\odot{O}$ . Since $\frac{OA}{AB} = \frac{OB}{AE}$ , we have that $AB = AE$ . Similarly, $CD = DF$
$OE = 100\sqrt{2} = \frac{OB}{2}$ and $EF=\frac{BC}{2}=100$ , so $AD=AE + EF + FD = 200 + 100 + 200 = \boxed{500}$"

radius = ","To save us from getting big numbers with lots of zeros behind them, let's divide all side lengths by $200$ for now, then multiply it back at the end of our solution.

Construct quadrilateral $ABCD$ on the circle with $AD$ being the missing side (Notice that since the side length is less than the radius, it will be very small on the top of the circle). Now, draw the radii from center $O$ to $A,B,C,$ and $D$ . Let the intersection of $BD$ and $OC$ be point $E$ . Notice that $BD$ and $OC$ are perpendicular because $BCDO$ is a kite.
We set lengths $BE=ED$ equal to $x$ (Solution 1.1 begins from here). By the Pythagorean Theorem, \[\sqrt{1^2-x^2}+\sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2-x^2}=\sqrt{2}\]
We solve for $x$ \[1-x^2+2-x^2+2\sqrt{(1-x^2)(2-x^2)}=2\] \[2\sqrt{(1-x^2)(2-x^2)}=2x^2-1\] \[4(1-x^2)(2-x^2)=(2x^2-1)^2\] \[8-12x^2+4x^4=4x^4-4x^2+1\] \[8x^2=7\] \[x=\frac{\sqrt{14}}{4}\]
By Ptolemy's Theorem \[AB \cdot CD + BC \cdot AD = AC \cdot BD = BD^2 = (2 \cdot BE)^2\]
Substituting values, \[1^2+1 \cdot AD = 4{\left( \frac{\sqrt{14}}{4} \right)}^2\] \[1+AD=\frac{7}{2}\] \[AD=\frac{5}{2}\]
Finally, we multiply back the $200$ that we divided by at the beginning of the problem to get $AD=\boxed{500}$"

Let quadrilateral $ABCD$ be inscribed in circle $O$ , where $AD$ is the side of unknown length. Draw the radii from center $O$ to all four vertices of the quadrilateral, and draw the altitude of $\triangle BOC$ such that it passes through side $AD$ at the point $G$ and meets side $BC$ at point $H$
By the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of $OH$ is \begin{align*} \sqrt{CO^2 - HC^2} &= \sqrt{(200\sqrt{2})^2 - \left(\frac{200}{2}\right)^2} \\ &= \sqrt{80000 - 10000} \\ &= \sqrt{70000} \\ &= 100\sqrt{7}. \end{align*}
Note that $[ABCDO] = [AOB] + [BOC] + [COD] = [AOD] + [ABCD].$ Let the length of $OG$ be $h$ and the length of $AD$ be $x$ ; then we have that
$[AOB] + [BOC] + [COD] = \frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} + \frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} + \frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{x \times h}{2} + \frac{(100\sqrt{7} - h)(200 + x)}{2} = [AOD] + [ABCD].$
Furthermore, \begin{align*} h &= \sqrt{OD^2 - GD^2} \\ &= \sqrt{(200\sqrt{2})^2 - \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2} \\ &= \sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}} \end{align*}
Substituting this value of $h$ into the previous equation and evaluating for $x$ , we get: \[\frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} + \frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} + \frac{200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{x \times h}{2} + \frac{(100\sqrt{7} - h)(200 + x)}{2}\] \[\frac{3 \times 200 \times 100\sqrt{7}}{2} = \frac{x\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}}{2} + \frac{\left(100\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\right)(200 + x)}{2}\] \[60000\sqrt{7} = \left(x\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\right) + \left(20000\sqrt{7}\right) + \left(100x\sqrt{7}\right) - \left(200\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\right) - \left(x\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\right)\] \[40000\sqrt{7} = 100x\sqrt{7} - 200\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\] \[400\sqrt{7} = x\sqrt{7} - 2\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\] \[(x - 400)\sqrt{7} = 2\sqrt{80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}}\] \[7(x-400)^2 = 4\left(80000 - \frac{x^2}{4}\right)\] \[7x^2 - 5600x + 1120000 = 320000 - x^2\] \[8x^2 - 5600x + 800000 = 0\] \[x^2 - 700x + 100000 = 0\]
The roots of this quadratic are found by using the quadratic formula: \begin{align*} x &= \frac{-(-700) \pm \sqrt{(-700)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 100000}}{2 \times 1} \\ &= \frac{700 \pm \sqrt{490000 - 400000}}{2} \\ &= \frac{700}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{90000}}{2} \\ &= 350 \pm \frac{300}{2} \\ &= 200, 500 \end{align*}
If the length of $AD$ is $200$ , then $ABCD$ would be a square. Thus, the radius of the circle would be \[\frac{\sqrt{200^2 + 200^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{80000}}{2} = \frac{200\sqrt{2}}{2} = 100\sqrt{2}\] Which is a contradiction. Therefore, our answer is $\boxed{500}.$"

### Solution: To solve this problem, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and some geometry.

Given:
- A quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with radius \(200\sqrt{2}\)
- Three sides of the quadrilateral have length \(200\)
- We need to find the length of the fourth side.

Let's denote the quadrilateral as \(ABCD\) with \(AB = BC = 200\), \(CD = x\) (the unknown side length), and \(AD\) being the fourth side.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Use the Circle's Radius:**
   The radius of the circle is \(200\sqrt{2}\). The diameter of the circle is \(400\sqrt{2}\).

2. **Properties of Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).

3. **Apply Ptolemy's Theorem:**
   Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of its two opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals.
   \[
   AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC = AC \cdot BD
   \]

4. **Use Symmetry and Geometry:**
   Since \(AB = BC = 200\) and the lengths are equal, we can infer that the quadrilateral is symmetric with respect to one of its diagonals.

Let's implement this in Python using sympy to solve for the length of the fourth side.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variables
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Given values
radius = ","[asy] size(250); defaultpen(linewidth(0.4)); //Variable Declarations real RADIUS; pair A, B, C, D, O; RADIUS=3;  //Variable Definitions A=RADIUS*dir(148.414); B=RADIUS*dir(109.471); C=RADIUS*dir(70.529); D=RADIUS*dir(31.586); O=(0,0);  //Path Definitions path quad= A -- B -- C -- D -- cycle;  //Initial Diagram draw(Circle(O, RADIUS), linewidth(0.8)); draw(quad, linewidth(0.8)); label(""$A$"",A,W); label(""$B$"",B,NW); label(""$C$"",C,NE); label(""$D$"",D,E); label(""$O$"",O,S); label(""$\theta$"",O,3N);  //Radii draw(O--A); draw(O--B); draw(O--C); draw(O--D);  //Angle mark for BOC draw(anglemark(C,O,B)); [/asy]
Construct quadrilateral $ABCD$ on the circle with $AD$ being the missing side (Notice that since the side length is less than the radius, it will be very small on the top of the circle). Now, draw the radii from center $O$ to $A,B,C,$ and $D$ . Apply the law of cosines on $\Delta BOC$ ; let $\theta = \angle BOC$ . We get the following equation: \[(BC)^{2}=(OB)^{2}+(OC)^{2}-2\cdot OB \cdot OC\cdot \cos\theta\] Substituting the values in, we get \[(200)^{2}=2\cdot (200)^{2}+ 2\cdot (200)^{2}- 2\cdot 2\cdot (200)^{2}\cdot \cos\theta\] Canceling out, we get \[\cos\theta=\frac{3}{4}\] Because $\angle AOB$ $\angle BOC$ , and $\angle COD$ are congruent, $\angle AOD = 3\theta$ . To find the remaining side ( $AD$ ), we simply have to apply the law of cosines to $\Delta AOD$ . Now, to find $\cos 3\theta$ , we can derive a formula that only uses $\cos\theta$ \[\cos 3\theta=\cos (2\theta+\theta)= \cos 2\theta \cos\theta- (2\sin\theta \cos\theta) \cdot \sin \theta\] \[\cos 3\theta= \cos\theta (\cos 2\theta-2\sin^{2}\theta)=\cos\theta (2\cos^{2}\theta-3+2\cos^{2}\theta)\] \[\Rightarrow \cos 3\theta=4\cos^{3}\theta-3\cos\theta\] It is useful to memorize the triple angle formulas ( $\cos 3\theta=4\cos^{3}\theta-3\cos\theta, \sin 3\theta=3\sin\theta-4\sin^{3}\theta$ ).  Plugging in $\cos\theta=\frac{3}{4}$ , we get $\cos 3\theta= -\frac{9}{16}$ . Now, applying law of cosines on triangle $OAD$ , we get \[(AD)^{2}= 2\cdot (200)^{2}+ 2\cdot (200)^{2}+2\cdot 200\sqrt2 \cdot 200\sqrt2 \cdot \frac{9}{16}\] \[\Rightarrow 2\cdot (200)^{2} \cdot (1+1+ \frac{9}{8})=(200)^{2}\cdot \frac{25}{4}\] \[AD=200 \cdot \frac{5}{2}=\boxed{500}\]"
