We know that if a row/column of numbers has a single multiple of $3$ , that entire row/column will be divisible by $3$ . Since there are $27$ multiples of $3$ from $1$ to $81$ , We need to find a way to place the $54$ non-multiples of $3$ such that they take up as many entire rows and columns as possible.
If we naively put in non-multiples of $3$ in $6$ rows from the top, we get $18 - 6 = 12$ rows that are multiples of $3$ . However, we can improve this number by making some rows and columns intersect so that some squares help fill out both rows and columns
We see that filling $7$ rows/columns would usually take $7 \times 9 = 63$ of our non-multiples, but if we do $4$ rows and $3$ columns, $12$ will intersect. With our $54$ being enough as we need only $51$ non-multiples of $3$ $63$ minus the $12$ overlapped).

The inner most circle has radius $1$ , and the second circle has radius 2. Therefore, the first shaded area has $4 \pi - \pi = 3 \pi$ area.

Therefore, Tiyo will have $12-10=2$ $1$ 's and $12-8=4$ $0$ 's in his record.
Now, all we have to do is figure out the order of these $1$ 's and $0$ 's. In every round, there are two games; the players are split into two pairs and the people in those pairs play each other. Thus, every round should have $2$ winners and $2$ losers which means that every column of the win-loss table should have $2$ $1$ 's and $2$ $0$ 's. Looking at the filled-in table so far, we see that columns $4$ and $6$ need one more $1$ , so Tiyo must have $1$ 's in those columns and $0$ 's gone in the others.

Since Viswam takes $1$ minute to walk along each block, it would take him $10$ minutes normally.
Viswam has already travelled for $5$ mins by the time he encounters the detour, so he must travel $7$ block lengths in the remaining $5$ minutes. The distance he has to travel is $7\cdot \frac{1}{20} = \frac{7}{20}$ of a mile. Therefore,
\[\frac{7}{20} \mathrm{\ miles} = r\cdot 5\mathrm{\ mins}.\] \[\frac{7\mathrm{\ miles}}{100\mathrm{\ mins}} = r.\]
As $60$ mins equals $1$ hour, we set up the following proportion:
\[r = \frac{7\mathrm{\ miles}}{100\mathrm{\ mins}} = \frac{m\mathrm{\ miles}}{60\mathrm{\ mins}}.\]
Cross multiplying and cancelling units yields
\[m = \frac{7\cdot 60}{100},\]

The first obvious step is to go some amount of moves in the right direction then subtract off in the left direction to land on $2023$ . The least amount of $3$ ’s added to $2023$ to make a multiple of $5$ is $4$ as $2023 + 4(3) = 2035$ .

We now simply have to subtract out the number of ways that $S$ and $T$ can be next to each other. If we place $S$ and $T$ next to each other in that order, then there are three places that we can place them, namely in the first two slots, in the second two slots, or in the last two slots (i.e. $ST\square\square, \square ST\square, \square\square ST$ ).

$\textit{Proof. (Created by AoPS user RedFireTruck)}$
Let our group of $a$ objects be represented like so $1$ $2$ $3$ , ..., $a-1$ $a$ . Let the last $b$ objects be the ones we can't have together.
Then we can organize our objects like so $\square1\square2\square3\square...\square a-b-1\square a-b\square$
We have $(a-b)!$ ways to arrange the objects in that list.
Now we have $a-b+1$ blanks and $b$ other objects so we have $_{a-b+1}P_{b}=\frac{(a-b+1)!}{(a-2b+1)!}$ ways to arrange the objects we can't put together.

We draw all the possible ways to get to Q. There are two ways to choose for row 2, and another two ways to choose for row 3. However, you can go to the ""edge"" or the farthest possible square westward of Q, so you can't multiply by 2 again. Notice how, at the first step, we figured that the answer was even, so choice D and E are eliminated, and after the second row, we realized it must be a multiple of 4, so choice B is eliminated. When we get to the fourth row, we do not multiply by 2 again, since we have limited possibilities rather than multiplying by 2 again. Choice C implies that there are two possibilities per row; however, we know that if you go to the farthest possible, you only have one possibility, so it is not $2^5 = 32$ so we know that the answer is choice $\boxed{28}$ .

Call the input $I$ and the output $O$ . If $I$ is even, $O=\frac{I}{2}$ , and if $I$ is odd, $O=3I+1$ . We can therefore see that $I=2O$ when $I$ is even and $I=\frac{O-1}{3}$ when $I$ is odd. Therefore, starting with $1$ , if $I$ is even, $I=2$ , and if $I$ is odd, $I=0$ , but the latter is not valid since $0$ is not actually odd. This means that the 2nd-to-last number in the sequence has to be $2$ . Now, substituting $2$ into the inverse formulae, if $I$ is even, $I=4$ (which is indeed even), and if $I$ is odd, $I=\frac{1}{3}$ , which is not an integer. This means the 3rd-to-last number in the sequence has to be $4$ . Substituting in $4$ , if $I$ is even, $I=8$ , but if $I$ is odd, $I=1$ . Both of these are valid solutions, so the 4th-to-last number can be either $1$ or $8$ . If it is $1$ , then by the argument we have just made, the 5th-to-last number has to be $2$ , the 6th-to-last number has to be $4$ , and the 7th-to-last number, which is the first number, must be either $1$ or $8$ . In this way, we have ultimately found two solutions: $N=1$ and $N=8$
On the other hand, if the 4th-to-last number is $8$ , substituting $8$ into the inverse formulae shows that the 5th-to-last number is either $16$ or $\frac{7}{3}$ , but the latter is not an integer. Substituting $16$ shows that if $I$ is even, $I=32$ , but if I is odd, $I=5$ , and both of these are valid. If the 6th-to-last number is $32$ , then the first number must be $64$ , since $\frac{31}{3}$ is not an integer; if the 6th-to-last number is $5,$ then the first number has to be $10$ , as $\frac{4}{3}$ is not an integer.

Thus, each student must receive either $1$ $2$ , or $3$ awards. If a student receives $3$ awards, then the other two students must each receive $1$ award; if a student receives $2$ awards, then another student must also receive $2$ awards and the remaining student must receive $1$ award. We consider each of these two cases in turn.
If a student receives three awards, there are $3$ ways to choose which student this is, and $\binom{5}{3}$ ways to give that student $3$ out of the $5$ awards. Next, there are $2$ students left and $2$ awards to give out, with each student getting one award. There are clearly just $2$ ways to distribute these two awards out, giving $3\cdot\binom{5}{3}\cdot 2=60$ ways to distribute the awards in this case.
In the other case, two students receive $2$ awards and one student recieves $1$ award . We know there are $3$ choices for which student gets $1$ award. There are $\binom{3}{1}$ ways to do this. Then, there are $\binom{5}{2}$ ways to give the first student his two awards, leaving $3$ awards yet to distribute. There are then $\binom{3}{2}$ ways to give the second student his $2$ awards. Finally, there is only $1$ student and $1$ award left, so there is only $1$ way to distribute this award. This results in $\binom{5}{2}\cdot\binom{3}{2}\cdot 1\cdot 3 =90$ ways to distribute the awards in this case. Adding the results of these two cases, we get $60+90=\boxed{150}$",150

In the first case, there are $\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose the person who gets 3 awards. From here, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways to choose the 3 awards from the 5 total awards. Now, one person has $2$ choices for awards and the other has $1$ choice for the award. Thus, the total number of ways to choose awards in this case is $3 \cdot 10 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 60$
In the other case, there are $\binom{3}{1} = 3$ ways to choose the person who gets 1 award, and $5$ choices for his/her award. Then, one person has $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to have his/her awards and the other person has $\dbinom{2}{2} = 1$ ways to have his/her awards. This gives $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 1  = 90$ ways for this case.
Adding these cases together, we get $60 + 90 = 150$ ways to distribute the awards, or choice $\boxed{150}$",150

If a student doesn't receive an award, there are $3$ choices for which student that is, so $2^5$ ways of choosing a student to receive each of the awards; in total, $3\cdot32=96$
However, if $2$ students both don't receive an award, then this case would be counted twice among the $96$ , so we need to add back in these cases. Said in other words, $2$ students not receiving an award is equivalent to $1$ student receiving $5$ awards, and there are $3$ choices for whom that student would be.

First, when we see the problem, we see ratios, and we see that this triangle basically has no special properties (right, has medians, etc.) and this screams mass points at us.
The triangle we will consider is $\triangle ABC$ (obviously), and we will let $E$ be the center of mass, so that $D$ balances $A$ and $C$ (this is true since $E$ balances $B$ and $D$ , but $E$ also balances $A$ and $B$ and $C$ so $D$ balances $A$ and $C$ ), and $F$ balances $B$ and $C$
We know that $AD:CD=1:2$ and $D$ balances $A$ and $C$ so we assign $2$ to $A$ and $1$ to $C$ . Then, since $D$ balances $A$ and $C$ , we get $D = A + C = 2 + 1 = 3$ (by mass points addition).
Next, since $E$ balances $B$ and $D$ in a ratio of $BE:DE=1:1$ , we know that $B=D=3$ . Similarly, by mass points addition, $E=B+D=3+3=6$
Finally, $F$ balances $B$ and $C$ so $F=B+C=3+1=4$ . We can confirm we have done everything right by noting that $E$ balances $A$ and $F$ , so $E$ should equal $A+F$ , which it does.
Now that our points have weights, we can solve the problem. $BF:FC=1:3$ so $BF:BC=1:4$ so $[ABF]=\frac{1}{4}[ABC]=90$ . Also, $EF:EA=2:4=1:2$ so $EF:AF=1:3$ so $[EBF]=\frac{1}{3}[ABF]=\boxed{30}$",30

Let $A[\Delta XYZ]$ $\text{Area of Triangle XYZ}$
$A[\Delta ABD]: A[\Delta DBC] :: 1:2 :: 120:240$
$A[\Delta ABE] = A[\Delta AED] = 60$ (the median divides the area of the triangle into two equal parts)
Construction: Draw a circumcircle around $\Delta ABD$ with $BD$ as is diameter. Extend $AF$ to $G$ such that it meets the circle at $G$ . Draw line $BG$
$A[\Delta ABD] = A[\Delta ABG] = 120$ (Since $\square ABGD$ is cyclic)
But $A[\Delta ABE]$ is common in both with an area of 60. So, $A[\Delta AED] = A[\Delta BEG]$
Therefore $A[\Delta AED] \cong A[\Delta BEG]$ (SAS Congruency Theorem).
In $\Delta AED$ , let $DI$ be the median of $\Delta AED$
which means $A[\Delta AID] = 30 = A[\Delta EID]$
Rotate $\Delta DEA$ to meet $D$ at $B$ and $A$ at $G$ $DE$ will fit exactly in $BE$ (both are radii of the circle). From the above solutions, $\frac{AE}{EF} = 2:1$
$AE$ is a radius and $EF$ is half of it implies $EF$ $\frac{radius}{2}$
which means $A[\Delta BEF] \cong A[\Delta DEI]$
Thus, $A[\Delta BEF] = \boxed{30}$",30

As triangle $ABC$ is loosely defined, we can arrange its points such that the diagram fits nicely on a coordinate plane. By doing so, we can construct it on graph paper and be able to visually determine the relative sizes of the triangles. As point $D$ splits line segment $\overline{AC}$ in a $1:2$ ratio, we draw $\overline{AC}$ as a vertical line segment $3$ units long. Point $D$ is thus $1$ unit below point $A$ and $2$ units above point $C$ . By definition, Point $E$ splits line segment $\overline{BD}$ in a $1:1$ ratio, so we draw $\overline{BD}$ $2$ units long directly left of $D$ and draw $E$ directly between $B$ and $D$ $1$ unit away from both. We then draw line segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}$ . We can easily tell that triangle $ABC$ occupies $3$ square units of space. Constructing line $AE$ and drawing $F$ at the intersection of $AE$ and $BC$ , we can easily see that triangle $EBF$ forms a right triangle occupying $\frac{1}{4}$ of a square unit of space. The ratio of the areas of triangle $EBF$ and triangle $ABC$ is thus $\frac{1}{4}\div3=\frac{1}{12}$ , and since the area of triangle $ABC$ is $360$ , this means that the area of triangle $EBF$ is $\frac{1}{12}\times360=\boxed{30}$",30

Using the same method, since $BE = \dfrac{1}{2} BD$ $[ABE] = \dfrac{1}{2} [ABD] = 60$ . Next, we draw $G$ on $\overline{BC}$ such that $\overline{DG}$ is parallel to $\overline{AF}$ and create segment $DG$ . We then observe that $\triangle AFC \sim \triangle DGC$ , and since $AD:DC = 1:2$ $FG:GC$ is also equal to $1:2$ . Similarly (no pun intended), $\triangle DBG \sim \triangle EBF$ , and since $BE:ED = 1:1$ $BF:FG$ is also equal to $1:1$ . Combining the information in these two ratios, we find that $BF:FG:GC = 1:1:2$ , or equivalently, $BF = \dfrac{1}{4} BC$ . Thus, $[BFA] = \dfrac{1}{4} [BCA] = 90$ .

Similarly, $\triangle DBC = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 360 = 240.$
Now, since $E$ is a midpoint of $BD$ $\triangle ABE = \triangle AED = 120 \div 2 = 60.$
We can use the fact that $E$ is a midpoint of $BD$ even further. Connect lines $E$ and $C$ so that $\triangle BEC$ and $\triangle DEC$ share 2 sides.
We know that $\triangle BEC=\triangle DEC=240 \div 2 = 120$ since $E$ is a midpoint of $BD.$
Let's label $\triangle BEF$ $x$ . We know that $\triangle EFC$ is $120-x$ since $\triangle BEC = 120.$
Note that with this information now, we can deduct more things that are needed to finish the solution.
Note that $\frac{EF}{AE} = \frac{120-x}{180} = \frac{x}{60}.$ because of triangles $EBF, ABE, AEC,$ and $EFC.$

This method uses the counting method of stars and bars (non-negative version). Since each person must have at least $2$ apples, we can remove $2*3$ apples from the total that need to be sorted. With the remaining $18$ apples, we can use stars and bars to determine the number of possibilities. Assume there are $18$ stars in a row, and $2$ bars, which will be placed to separate the stars into groups of $3$ . In total, there are $18$ spaces for stars $+ 2$ spaces for bars, for a total of $20$ spaces. We can now do $20 \choose 2$ . This is because if we choose distinct $2$ spots for the bars to be placed, each combo of $3$ groups will be different, and all apples will add up to $18$ . We can also do this because the apples are indistinguishable. $20 \choose 2$ is $190$ , therefore the answer is $\boxed{190}$",190

Notice that we only have $1$ way to assign the numbers $a,b,c$ to Alice, Becky, and Chris when $a=b=c$ . As this only happens $1$ way ( $a=b=c=8$ ), our answer is $1+3y+6z$ for some $y,z$ .

Claim: Given a square $ABCD$ , let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{DC}$ and let $BE\cap AC = F$ . Then $\frac {AF}{FC}=2$
Proof: We use Cartesian coordinates. Let $D$ be the origin, $A=(0,1),C=(0,1),B=(1,1)$ . We have that $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{EB}$ are governed by the equations $y=-x+1$ and $y=2x-1$ , respectively. Solving, $F=\left(\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)$ . The result follows. $\square$

Now, we easily discover that line $CF$ has lattice coordinates at $(1,4)$ and $(3,0)$ . Hence, the slope of line $CF=-2$
Plugging in the rest of the coordinate points, we find that line $CF=-2x+6$
Doing the same process to line $BE$ , we find that line $BE=2x$
Hence, setting them equal to find the intersection point...
$y=2x=-2x+6\implies 4x=6\implies x=\frac{3}{2}\implies y=3$
Hence, we find that the intersection point is $(\frac{3}{2},3)$ . Call it Z.
Now, we can see that
$E=(0,0)$
$Z=(\dfrac{3}{2},3)$
$C=(1,4)$

$d$ $20$ minutes

$d$ $20$ minutes = $3$ d : $60$ minutes
$d$ $12$ minutes = $5$ d : $60$ minutes

Since you can't have $7.6$ games, we know that we can only check $M=7$ since we know that since $M>4, M<7.6, M\equiv1 \pmod{3}$ . After checking $M=7$ , we find that it works.

Then, to find the LCM, we have to find the greatest power of all the numbers there are; if one number is one but not the other, use it (this is $3^3, 5, 11, 2^2$ ). Multiply all of these to get 5940.
For the GCF of 180 and 594, use the least power of all of the numbers that are in both factorizations and multiply. $3^2 \times 2$ = 18.

On Monday, he was at a rate of $5 \text{ m.p.h}$ . So, $5x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x = \frac{2}{5} \text { hours}$
For Wednesday, he walked at a rate of $3 \text{ m.p.h}$ . Therefore, $3x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x = \frac{2}{3}  \text { hours}$
On Friday, he walked at a rate of $4 \text{ m.p.h}$ . So, $4x = 2 \text{ miles}\implies x=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}  \text {hours}$
Adding up the hours yields $\frac{2}{5}  \text { hours}$ $\frac{2}{3}  \text { hours}$ $\frac{1}{2}  \text { hours}$ $\frac{47}{30}  \text { hours}$

Draw a square around the star figure. The side length of this square is $4$ , because the side length is the diameter of the circle. The square forms $4$ -quarter circles around the star figure. This is the equivalent of one large circle with radius $2$ , meaning that the total area of the quarter circles is $4\pi$ . The area of the square is $16$ .

"What is the tens digit of $7^{2011}$
$\textbf{(A) }0\qquad\textbf{(B) }1\qquad\textbf{(C) }3\qquad\textbf{(D) }4\qquad\textbf{(E) }7$","We can use patterns to figure out the answer.
7 to the power of 2 is 49. So, the tens digit is 4.
7 to the power of 3 is 343. So, the tens digit is 4. 
7 to the power of 4 is 2401.So, the tens digit is 0.
7 to the power of 5 is 16807. So, the tens digit is 0.
By now, we can notice the pattern. The tens digit for 7 to the power of 2 is 4, then 4, then 0, then 0. It keeps on going, 2 fours, and then 2 zeros in 4 numbers. If we round up for 2011/4, we get 503. 503 * 4 is 2012. So 7 to the 2012 power has a tens digit of 0, since 2012 is a mutiple of 4, and 7 to the power of 4 has a tens digit of 0. We have to subtract a power from 7 to the 2012 power, so the tens digit goes back from 0 to 4 because if we subtract a power from 7 to the power of 4, we have 7 to the power of 3, which has a tens digit of 4. Hence the answer is $\boxed{4}$",4

Since the number of people wearing a hat or a glove must be whole numbers, the number of people in the room must be a multiple of (4,5), but we do lcm of 4,5 = 20. Since we are trying to find the minimum $x$ , we must use the smallest possible value for the number of people in the room. Similarly, we can assume that there are no people present who are wearing neither of the two items since this would unnecessarily increase the number of people in the room. Thus, we can say that there are $20$ people in the room, all of which are wearing at least a hat or a glove.
It follows that there are $\frac{2}{5}\cdot 20 = 8$ people wearing gloves and $\frac{3}{4}\cdot 20 = 15$ people wearing hats. Then by applying the Principle of Inclusion Exclusion (PIE), the total number of people in the room wearing either a hat or a glove or both is $8+15-x = 23-x$ .

Case 1: $x^\circ$ is a base angle with the $70^\circ$ as the other angle:
Here, $x=70$ , since base angles are congruent.
Case 2: $x^\circ$ is a base angle with $70^\circ$ as the vertex angle:
Here, the 2 base angles are both $x^\circ$ , so we can use the equation $2x+70=180$ , which simplifies to $x=55$
Case 3: $x^\circ$ is the vertex angle with $70^\circ$ as a base angle:
Here, both base angles are $70^\circ$ , since base angles are congruent. Thus, we can use the equation $x+140=180$ , which simplifies to $x=40$

If any odd prime is added to 59, an even number will be obtained. However, the only way to obtain this even number(common sum) would be to add another even number to 44, and a different one to 38. Since there is only one even prime (2), the middle card's hidden number cannot be an odd prime, and so must be even. Therefore, the middle card's hidden number must be 2, so the constant sum is $59+2=61$ . Thus, the first card's hidden number is $61-44=17$ , and the last card's hidden number is $61-38=23$

Draw segments $AC$ and $BC$ . 
Drawing an altitude in an isoceles triangle splits the triangle into 2 congruent triangles and we also know that $YC=CZ$ $AB$ is the line that connects the midpoints of two sides of a triangle together, which means that $AB$ is parallel to and half in length of $YZ$ . Then $AB=YC=CZ$ .
Since $AB$ is parallel to $YZ$ , and $XY$ is the transversal, $\angle XAB=\angle AYC.$ Similarly, $\angle XBA=\angle BZC.$ Then, by SAS, $\triangle XAB=\triangle AYC=\triangle BZC$ .
Since corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent, $AC=BC=XA$ .
Since ACY and BCZ are now isosceles triangles, $\angle AYC=\angle ACY$ and $\angle BZC=\angle BCZ$ Using the fact that $AB$ is parallel to $YZ$ $\angle ACY=\angle CAB$ and $\angle BCZ=\angle CBA$ . 
Now $\triangle XAB=\triangle AYC=\triangle BZC=\triangle ABC$ .
Draw an altitude through each of them such that each triangle is split into two congruent right triangles. Now there are a total of 8 congruent small triangles, each with area 1. The shaded area has three of these triangles, so it has area 3.

If you just look at the diagram you can easily see that the triangles are congruent and you would solve this a lot faster.

With SAS congruence, triangles $XCY$ and $XCZ$ are congruent. Hence, triangle $XCY = \frac{8}{2} = 4$ . (Let's say point $D$ is the intersection between line segments $XC$ and $AB$ .) We can find the area of the trapezoid $ADCY$ by subtracting the area of triangle $XAD$ from $4$
We find the area of triangle $XAD$ by the $\frac{bh}{2}$ formula- $\frac{XD\cdot AD}{2} = \frac{\frac{XC}{2}\cdot AD}{2}$ $AD$ is $\frac{1}{4}$ of $YZ$ from solution 1. The area of $XAD$ is \[\frac{\frac{XC}{2}\cdot \frac{YZ}{4}}{2} = \frac{16}{16} = 1\]

We draw the triangles as shown above. What seems like a half-square (or a corner of a square) indicates $90$ °. (This is not a random idea - the two original two triangles on the top inspires us to do so.)
Note that $\overline{AD}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{YC}$ $\overline{BE}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{CZ}$
$\overline{AB}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{YZ}$ , so because of corresponding angles theorem, $\angle YAD=\angle AXF$ . We are also told $\overline{YA}=\overline{AX}$ . Both $\bigtriangleup \text{XAF}$ and $\bigtriangleup \text{AYD}$ have a $90$ ° angle. Because of AAS Congruency (Angle-Angle-Side; $90$ °, $\angle YAD$ , and side $\overline{YA}$ ), $\bigtriangleup \text{XAF}$ is congruent to $\bigtriangleup \text{AYD}$ . Because of symmetry, the same goes for $\bigtriangleup \text{XFB}$ and $\bigtriangleup \text{BEZ}$
$\bigtriangleup \text{YAD}$ is congruent to $\bigtriangleup \text{CAD}$ , which is congruent to $\bigtriangleup \text{ACF}$ because of symmetry. So there are $4$ congruent triangles on the left side. There is also $4$ congruent triangles on the right side because of symmetry.
There are $8$ congruent triangles in all. We are told the area of the triangle $\bigtriangleup \text{XYZ}$ is 8. $8\div8=1$ , so each of the small congruent triangles is $1$ . The shaded area contains $3$ small triangles, so the area of the shaded section is $1\cdot3=\boxed{3}$",3

If the larger number were twice the smaller number, then the smallest possibility for the larger number is $2457\times2=4914$ , since $2457$ is the smallest number in the set. The largest possibility would have to be twice the largest number in the set such that when it is multiplied by $2$ , it is less than or equal to $7542$ , the largest number in the set. This happens to be $2754\times2=5508$ . Therefore, the number would have to be between $4914$ and $5508$ , and also even. The only even numbers in the set and in this range are $5472$ and $5274$ . A quick check reveals that neither of these numbers is twice a number in the set. The number can't be quadruple or more another number in the set since $2457\times4=9828$ , well past the range of the set. Therefore, the number must be triple another number in the set. The least possibility is $2457\times3=7371$ and the greatest is $2475\times3=7425$ , since any higher number in the set multiplied by $3$ would be out of the range of the set.

"Which of these numbers is less than its reciprocal?
$\text{(A)}\ -2 \qquad \text{(B)}\ -1 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 0 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 1 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2$","The statement ""a number is less than its reciprocal"" can be translated as $x < \frac{1}{x}$
Multiplication by $x$ can be done if you do it in three parts: $x>0$ $x=0$ , and $x<0$ .  You have to be careful about the direction of the inequality, as you do not know the sign of $x$
If $x>0$ , the sign of the inequality remains the same.  Thus, we have $x^2 < 1$ when $x > 0$ .  This leads to $0 < x < 1$
If $x=0$ , the inequality $x < \frac{1}{x}$ is undefined.
If $x<0$ , the sign of the inequality must be switched.  Thus, we have $x^2 > 1$ when $x < 0$ .  This leads to $x < -1$
Putting the solutions together, we have $x<-1$ or $0 < x < 1$ , or in interval notation, $(-\infty, -1) \cup(0, 1)$ .  The only answer in that range is $\boxed{2}$",2
"Which of these numbers is less than its reciprocal?
$\text{(A)}\ -2 \qquad \text{(B)}\ -1 \qquad \text{(C)}\ 0 \qquad \text{(D)}\ 1 \qquad \text{(E)}\ 2$","Starting again with $x < \frac{1}{x}$ , we avoid multiplication by $x$ .   Instead, move everything to the left, and find a common denominator:
$x < \frac{1}{x}$
$x - \frac{1}{x} < 0$
$\frac{x^2 - 1}{x} < 0$
$\frac{(x+1)(x-1)}{x} < 0$
Divide this expression at $x=-1$ $x=0$ , and $x=1$ , as those are the three points where the expression on the left will ""change sign"".
If $x<-1$ , all three of those terms will be negative, and the inequality is true.  Therefore, $(-\infty, -1)$ is part of our solution set.
If $-1 < x < 0$ , the $(x+1)$ term will become positive, but the other two terms remain negative.  Thus, there are no solutions in this region.
If $0 < x < 1$ , then both $(x+1)$ and $x$ are positive, while $(x-1)$ remains negative.  Thus, the entire region $(0, -1)$ is part of the solution set.
If $1 < x$ , then all three terms are positive, and there are no solutions.
At all three ""boundary points"", the function is either $0$ or undefined.  Therefore, the entire solution set is $(-\infty, -1) \cup (0, 1)$ , and the only option in that region is $x=-2$ , leading to $\boxed{2}$",2

You must have $1$ more penny.  If you had more than $1$ penny, you must have at least $6$ pennies to leave a multiple of $5$ for the nickels, dimes, and quarters.  But you only have $5$ more coins to assign.
Now you have $61 - 1 = 60$ cents remaining for $4$ coins, which may be nickels, quarters, or dimes.  If you have only one more dime, that leaves $50$ cents in $3$ nickels or quarters, which is impossible.

If you have three dimes, that leaves $30$ cents for $1$ nickel or quarter, which is still impossible.  And all four remaining coins being dimes will not be enough.
Therefore, you must have no more dimes to assign, and the $60$ cents in $4$ coins must be divided between the quarters and nickels.  We quickly see that $2$ nickels and $2$ quarters work.  Thus, the total count is $2$ quarters, $2$ nickels, $1$ penny, plus one more coin of each type that we originally subtracted.

But start with $\triangle AGF$ , since that's where most of our information is.  Looking at $\triangle AGF$ , since $\angle F = \angle G$ , and $\angle A = 20$ , we can write:

$\frac{16600}{200}=83$ -fold increase in population.
Thus, the population increases by a factor $83$ .  This is very close to $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81$ , and so there are about $4$ triplings of the island's population.

Finally, you repeat this on the third layer, for $4$ more cubes.

There are $16$ cubes on the bottom, but by counting the cubes on the sides, $12$ of the cubes are already accounted for. $16-12=4$ cubes on the bottom that aren't already counted.

They can also be generated by starting with $1$ , and adding $1, 2, 3, 4...$ as in the description of the problem.
Squares that have the same remainder after being divided by $8$ will be in the same column.  Thus, we want to find when the last remainder, from $0$ to $7$ , is found.
So, instead of adding $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...$ , we can effectively either add $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3...$ or subtract $7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, 5...$ if we are only concerned about remainders when divided by $8$ .

$1 + 2 = 3$
$3 + 3 = 6$
$6 - 4 = 2$

$1 - 1 = 0$

If we make the numbers on either end $9$ and $8$ in some order, the middle number will be $6$ .  This is the minimum for the intersection.
Looking at the horizontal row, the four numbers sum to $12$ .  If we minimize the three numbers on the right to $123$ , the first number has a maximum value of $6$ .  This is the maximum for the intersection
Thus, the minimum of the intersection is $6$ , and the maximum of the intersection is $6$ .  This means the intersection must be $6$ , and the other numbers must be $9$ and $8$ in the column, and $123$ in the row.  The sum of all the numbers is $12 + 23 - 6 = 29$ , and the answer is $\boxed{29}$",29

To determine the last digit of $1492\cdot 1776\cdot 1812\cdot 1996$ , you only need to look at the last digit of each number in the product.  Thus, we compute $2\cdot 6\cdot 2\cdot 6 = 12^2 = 144$ .  The last digit of the number $1492\cdot 1776\cdot 1812\cdot 1996$ is also $4$ , and thus the remainder when the number is divided by $5$ is also $4$ , which gives an answer of $\boxed{4}$",4

Since there are not three even numbers in the given set, $E+E+E$ is impossible.  Thus, we must choose two odd numbers, and one even number.
There are $2$ choices for the even number.
There are $4$ choices for the first odd number.  There are $3$ choices for the last odd number.  But the order in which we pick these 2 numbers doesn't matter, so this overcounts the pairs of odd numbers by a factor of $2$ .   Thus, we have $\frac{4\cdot 3}{2} = 6$ choices for a pair of odd numbers.
